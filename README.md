# docs

Files needed to generate [RetroAchievements.org documentation pages](https://retroachievements.github.io/docs/)

The **RetroAchievements Documentation Project** is divided into two parts:

1. **[RAwiki](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs/wiki/)**
2. **[RAdocs](https://retroachievements.github.io/docs/)**

The wiki is where the documents are created and edited. Anyone (with a github account) is able to edit the wiki's content. Then, if you have something to share, please edit the wiki!

The [RAdocs](https://retroachievements.github.io/docs/) website has (almost) the same content as the wiki, but with a more pleasant look. The content of this website is generated by its maintainers using the wiki's content as input.

**When a change is made in the wiki this change is NOT instantaneously reflected in the docs.** The convertion is performed by a maintainer from time to time.
