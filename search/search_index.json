Keep in mind that changes come for a better quality. Now let's elaborate why we are saying that. RetroAchievements is a \"young\" project and is constantly evolving. It was launched in the late 2012, and in the early days the emulators and the site (database stuff, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) were developed by a single person: Scott . Therefore the evolution occurred slowly. Another thing that was occurring very slowly in the early days was the diffusion of knowledge about achievement creation. Specially about good practices when creating achievements. There wasn't documentation at that time (RADocs only started in November/2017). People were learning to create achievements by sharing knowledge on forum threads and/or by personal messages. In the early days the community didn't have a very clear a concept of what a good achievement design is. And it resulted in many poorly designed sets compared to our current standards (e.g. sets with only progress-based achievements). We also didn't have much experience of how achievements could be protected against in-game cheats or battery save abusing. That's why from time to time some achievement sets receive revisions. We make set revisions with quality in mind, and to show actual respect for the game . When a revision is going to happen, we try to involve the community by discussing on our forums (usually the official game's topic) and/or on our discord server. We are aware that this is insufficient to reach all interested people, but it is the way we are currently using. We are working on new ways to discuss revisions with the community by implementing some new social features on the RA website, but while those features are not implemented, we'll keep using the forums and discord. If you would like to propose new methods for discussing revisions, we are open to suggestions.

Bendyhuman DanielARP Draco655 dude1286 KingS1zzle LootusMaximus Shootzy Short History link The RetroAchievements project was created by Scott Davies in 2012 . He hacked some open source emulators to add the RetroAchievements feature and coded all the backend/website mostly alone. By January 2014, there were 4 RA emulators, over 5000 achievements to earn (thanks to the devotion of many passionate achievement developers ) and over 1000 players registered. After a couple of years Scott was called by the real life the website development went into a period of hiatus with just a few sporadic improvements (the achievement developers were continually working on more and more games, though). In late 2015 leiradel started to work to integrate the RetroAchievements feature into RetroArch . And, as RetroArch is able to run on a wide variety of platforms (such as Mac and Linux) and devices (such as Android phones and Raspberry pi), it helped a lot to increase the popularity of the RetroAchievements project. As the site slowly grew, so did the bandwidth costs, so in late 2016, Scott reached out to the community and they suggested doing a Patreon to keep the site going. After implementing it, the community response was fantastic, which allowed the site to continue completely ad-free . Mid 2017 the RetroAchievements Discord server was started and it made communication across the community much easier. Since then, many knowledgeable members (coders, web developers, etc.) joined the scene volunteering to contribute to the project. Up to this point all the achievement creation knowledge was scattered in several forum posts, making it very tough for a newbie to learn how to create achievements.

No el lado t\u00e9cnico sino el conceptual. Este contenido es un resumen de lo que originalmente escribi\u00f3 el usuario de RA cirellio en un tema del foro . Logros basados en Progresi\u00f3n link Hay 3 tipos de logros basados en progresi\u00f3n: progresi\u00f3n simple, progresi\u00f3n basada en historia, y logros de progresi\u00f3n/colecci\u00f3n. Progresion Simple link Logros basados en progresi\u00f3n son usualmente los mas simples, especialmente si el juego que estas haciendo es nada mas que eso. O no tiene mucho que ver con una trama/historia o algo parecido. En este caso, veamos algunos BUENOS y MALOS ejemplos sobre esto: Bueno: Completa el stage 1. Malo: Llega al stage 2. Toma ligeramente mas trabajo programar un logro donde el jugador necesita completar un stage en vez de simple llegar al siguiente. Pero es aparte mas satisfactorio para el jugador, y se ve mucho mas profesional. Aparte tambi\u00e9n es menos susceptible a problemas donde los jugadores cargan partidas de guardado o estados de guardado (savestates) para logros gratis . Bueno: Completa el juego. Malo: Empieza el juego. Es cierto que los logros basados en progresi\u00f3n son usualmente logros regalados, pero generalmente todos estamos de acuerdo en que un logro sobre empezar el juego es demasiado f\u00e1cil, y no del todo memorable para el jugador. Es simplemente es una norma, sin embargo es muchas veces la parte mas memorable de un juego para el jugador, y completar un juego es definitivamente un logro en si. Es correcto hacer un logro que funcione de la siguiente manera \"Completa el ultimo mundo y completa el juego\". Bueno: Completa los stages con tem\u00e1tica de nieve, Completa los primeros cinco stages, o Completa los primeros diez stages. Malo: Completa el Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (todos los logros por separado) Una de las peores cosas que puedes hacer es spammear logros. Juegos de Puzzle son notorios por tener ese tipo de problemas, porque los stages son cortos y por lo regular, hay cientos o hasta mas. Como resultado, el feed de la pagina principal termina con un mont\u00f3n de micro-actualizaciones, y sacan a los logros de otros usuarios r\u00e1pidamente del feed. La manera de corregir esto de la manera mas profesional posible es espaciar los logros un poco mas, en grupos de stages. Por ejemplo, si los stages 1-10 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica de fuego, y los stages 11-20 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica del espacio, puedes crear logros basados en esas tem\u00e1ticas. Se creativo. Progresion Basada en Historia: link Los momentos mas memorables en la historia de los videojuegos usualmente no est\u00e1n relacionados a coleccionar un \u00edtem o a misiones secundarias, sino a escenas especificas relacionadas con la historia. Ejemplos: Primer encuentro con Pyramid Head en la serie de Silent Hill. Encontrando la verdad sobre Darth Revan en Knights of the Old Republic. Encontrando que es lo que va a pasar en el futuro en Chrono Trigger. Lanzando la Vaca en Earthworm Jim. Casi cualquier muerte de alg\u00fan personaje. La cosa es de ser extremadamente cuidados con los spoilers. Si encuentras alg\u00fan logro relacionado con historia y cuenta con un spoiler, contacta al desarrollador responsable. Y a los desarrolladores, por favor sean comprensivos cuando se trate de critica constructiva, el numero y el porcentaje de este tipo de logros varia de juego en juego--Esto realmente se vasa en que tan fuertemente el juego esta enfocado en su historia. Progresi\u00f3n/Colecci\u00f3n link Progresi\u00f3n/Colecci\u00f3n es com\u00fanmente un h\u00edbrido. No solo estas coleccionando un \u00edtem, sino tambi\u00e9n sale una memorable (y mandataria) escena. Ejemplos: Obtener la Master Sword en A Link to the Past, que levanta la maldici\u00f3n en Lost Woods. Encontrar la espada en la playa en Link's Awakening, y sale la primer escena en el que el sabio b\u00faho habla contigo. Escoger tu Pokemon, el cual sucede en escena del principio, pero b\u00e1sicamente es 'un ritual' para la mayor\u00eda de jugadores. Logros en esta categor\u00eda h\u00edbrida tipicamente mas satisfactorios ya que hacen doble-trabajo. El jugador no esta solamente obteniendo un \u00edtem, sino tambi\u00e9n viendo una escena memorable y obteniendo un logro a la vez. Bastante dosis de endorfinas! Progresion Pros y Contras link Logros basados en progresi\u00f3n son garantizados que le van a salir al jugador en un play-through normal. Entonces para que tenerlos en primer lugar? Pros link Un jugador merece puntos por jugar un jugar! A si lo es! Recuerda, bastantes usuarios estan jugando estos juegos por primera vez, y la mayor\u00eda de los juegos son algo dif\u00edciles de pasar. Porque no deber\u00edamos de recompensarlos por un buen y cl\u00e1sico play-through? Logros de progresi\u00f3n constantes a largo plazo motivan a los jugadores a completar el juego. Algunos jugadores en este sitio web son mas casuales y no intentan hacer muchos mas que pasar juegos. No todos sienten la necesidad de Masterizar cada juego en Hardcore mode. Muchos son perfectamente felices agarrando uno que otro logro aparte durante su play-through normal, y no hay nada malo con eso. Algunas escenas son memorables, y merecen sus propio logros! Gente que creci\u00f3 con estos juegos mueren por ver esas escenas en la lista de logros, y tal vez les llegue un poco al coraz\u00f3n cuando vean que ya consiguieron ese logro. Los Logros basados en progresi\u00f3n ayudan a otros usuarios a medir que tan lejos esta un jugador en el juego, un poco como Rich Presence. Podemos decirle algo al jugador como, \"Buena suerte!\" porque sabemos que la siguiente secci\u00f3n sera bastante complicada. Motiva a la comunidad a interactuar. El orden importa! Logros de Progresion nos pueden decir sobre un play-through simplemente con el orden en el que salieron. Si sacaste un logro por ese jefe opcional y te ahorraste un mill\u00f3n de dolares DESPU\u00c9S de a ver hecho todas las sidequests, ese es mucho meno impresionante si conseguiste hacerlo antes de la mitad del juego. En otras palabras, Logros de Progresion nos dan la oportunidad de mostrar un poco como jugamos! Podemos mostrarle al mundo que vencimos al ultimo jefe antes de llegar al nivel 10, o que pudimos vence el modo experto en nuestra primera pasada sin a ver intentado anteriormente F\u00e1cil o Normal. Incluso puede revelar si utilizamos glitches o trucos para saltarnos cierta parte del juego . As\u00ed que, como puedes ver, Logros de Progresion tienen una gran SINERGIA con otros tipos de logros. Este tipo de logros son los mas f\u00e1ciles de programar y est\u00e1n generalmente libre de errores. Contras link Demasiados logros de progresi\u00f3n pueden sobre-saturar un juego con logros 'regalados', y eso es algo Muy Malo. Si tu juego tiene nada mas que este tipo de logros, es simplemente otro play-through aburrido para los jugadores. Llega al stage 2, Llega al stage 3, Llega al stage 4, Completa el Juego. Esta es una buena 'base' para agregar logros de otras categor\u00edas, pero no dejes tu lista en solamente logros de Progresion . De otra manera simplemente estas regalando puntos por algo que los jugadores han hecho un mill\u00f3n de veces anteriormente. Logros de Sidequests/Opcionales link Los juegos de anta\u00f1o, por lo general, ofrecen de muy poco a nada por vencer un modo extra, mas all\u00e1 de simplemente hacerlo en un d\u00eda lluvioso despu\u00e9s de pasar el juego. Los juegos viejos no contaban con una conexi\u00f3n a Internet. Y no contaban con aspectos sociales mas all\u00e1 del modo de 2-jugadores, y tal vez decirle a tus amigos que pasaste algo. Pero ahora, con RetroAchievements.org, podemos mostrar nuestros logros de anta\u00f1o (incluso si implica volver a hacer lo que hicimos hace a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s). Estos Trofeos son medallas de honor. Puedes observar con ver los logros de otro compa\u00f1ero y empezar a entender que tan lejos a llegado, que tanta habilidad tiene. Junto con eso tambi\u00e9n viene el respeto hacia otros compa\u00f1eros. Socializamos, felicitamos a cualquiera que hubiera hecho un buen trabajo. Sentimos como si perteneci\u00e9ramos, y estuvi\u00e9ramos en buena compa\u00f1\u00eda. Misiones Secundarias link A menudo hay cosas que el jugador puede hacer, pero no son necesarias de completar. En otras palabras, un reto hecho por los desarrolladores. Usualmente son divertidas, o algunas veces no tanto, pero merecen un precio porque requieren de trabajo duro y persistencia para lograrlos. Tienes que caminar por una cuerda floja entre si los jugadores dedicados har\u00e1n algo al respecto, vs. si la meta es algo est\u00fapido. La gente simplemente le va a dar la vuelta, as\u00ed que ten eso en mente. Algunas veces, este tipo de logros son incluso Easter Eggs o cosas que el jugador en toda su vida jam\u00e1s supo que exist\u00edan! Muchos jugadores adoran este tipo de logros. Yo pienso porque aprenden algo nuevo de un juego con el que crecieron, o pensaban que eran los \u00fanicos que saben sobre ello y se emocionan al verlo como un logro aqu\u00ed. Es realmente importante para nosotros los desarrolladores REALMENTE conocer el juego por dentro y por fuera antes de crear un set de logros. Ejemplos de Misiones Secundarias: Entregar colas al Colector de Colar en Final Fantasy IV. Encontrar el due\u00f1o del \u00cdtem Insignificante en Earthbound. Entregar el Jerky a el Rey en el Castillo de Guardia. La misi\u00f3n de Anju en Majora's Mask. Saber mas del pasado de Wrex en Mass Effect. Las misiones de escolta de Diplomacia/VIP en Flashback: The Quest for Identity. Descubrir un cuarto secreto. Las misiones secundarias son mas com\u00fanmente encontradas en RPGs, pero especialmente en estos d\u00edas, las sidequests se encuentra pr\u00e1cticamente en cualquier genero. Manten los ojos bien abiertos - Incluso el plataformero que menos piensas podr\u00eda tener una o dos sidequests. La serie de Kirby, en algunos casos, cuenta con \u00e1reas y cuartos escondidos. Algunas veces, las sidequests terminan otorgando un \u00edtem, que cae en un hibrido de: Misiones Secundarias/Colleccionables. Logros Opcionales link Ejemplos de Logros Opcionales: Jefes opcionales. Completar un calabozo de reto (que es un h\u00edbrido de una Sidequest). Completar el Modo Experto (que es un h\u00edbrido de Progresion). Completar un nivel de reto secreto. Conseguir un \u00edtem bastante raro de un monstruo. Completar el juego con un personaje opcional. Obtener alguna puntuaci\u00f3n. Completar caracter\u00edsticas que solo se desbloquean en la segunda pasada. Modos de juego que solo se desbloquean en m\u00faltiples pasadas. Finales del juego opcionales. C\u00f3digos que puedes introducir en la pantalla de t\u00edtulo para hacer el juego mas dificil. Estos son los desarrolladores del juego esperando a que te guste su juego lo suficiente para que vuelvas a el aun mas, incluso despu\u00e9s que hubieran rodado los cr\u00e9ditos. Ellos intentan recompensar al jugador por completar su juego, y crear un poco mas de re-jugabilidad. Si los desarrolladores del juego se dieron la molestia de hacer cosas como estas una parte integral del juego, nosotros como desarrolladores de logros deber\u00edamos de reconocer estos retos y crear los logros adecuados tan siquiera para algunos de ellos. Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, y Star Ocean: The Second Story son famosos por hacer esto. Las entregas para el Game Boy Advance de Castlevania tambi\u00e9n hacen esto. En efecto, muchos juegos lo hacen. Si no estas completamente seguro de que tu juego cuente con modos extras o retos, procura hacer un poco de research y checar algunos FAQs. O tambi\u00e9n puedes preg\u00fantale a la comunidad de aqu\u00ed, varios de nosotros somo expertos en varios juegos de aqu\u00ed. Sidequests/Opcionales Pros y Contras link Los logros de Sidequests/Opcionales son fant\u00e1sticos suplementos para los logros de Progresion. Pros link Esta es el pan-y-mantequilla de los logros. Chances hay de que, una buena cantidad de tus logros vengan de esta categor\u00eda. Todos los juegos tienen cosas opcionales que hacer. Colecciona todas las monedas en un nivel! Consigue 9 vidas! Crear logros de este tipo es f\u00e1cil, y recompensa al jugador por su dedicaci\u00f3n. Los desarrolladores de juegos aman a los jugadores que aprecian las cosas. Les gusta cuando los jugadores se toman la molestia de adentrarse profundamente en sus juegos, apreciando su trabajo duro, de otra manera no mirar\u00edamos cosas 'divertidas' escondidas en juegos como Easter Eggs, escenas bonus, etc. Si los desarrolladores de juegos recompensan al jugador por hacerlo, porque nosotros no? Nosotros desarrolladores tambi\u00e9n tenemos que reconocer cuando el jugador a recorrido una milla extra. Los jugadores aman decirle a sus amigos cuando encuentran algo inusual y fuera de lo com\u00fan en un juego. Con este sitio, ellos pueden mostrarle a sus amigos que si mataron a la 'rana amarilla' que rara vez se ve en el pantano, o encontraron el transportador a la 'dimensi\u00f3n desconocida'. Si incluimos estas curiosidades en nuestras listas de logros, le estamos demostrando a los jugadores que 'estamos informados', que crea confianza en que podemos guiarlos completamente por el juego. Logros de Sidequests/Opcionales le dan a los jugadores algo por lo que esforzarse despu\u00e9s de haber pasado el juego. Estos tipos de logros pueden ser com\u00fanmente conseguidos en cualquier momento. Los jugadores sienten un llegue mas fuerte de endorfinas cuando un logro sale cuando ellos no esperaban conseguirlo, pero se le fue premiado. Estos tipos de logros son por lo general f\u00e1ciles de programar, despu\u00e9s de los logros tipo progresi\u00f3n. Contras link A algunos jugadores no les interesa explorar mas all\u00e1 de lo que ofrece el t\u00edpico play-through, as\u00ed que un set con un gran porcentaje de este tipo de logros pueden sentir al jugador como si no se le hubiera premiado lo suficiente. (Por supuesto, este tipo de jugador es un poco raro en un sitio web centrado en logros.) Alguna gente podr\u00eda sentir que un reto en especifico es muy complicado, incluso si es algo que originalmente los desarrolladores incluyeron para que los jugadores lo consigan. Cuando creas un logro de Sidequests/Opcional digamos, por ejemplo, escapa de 999 batallas (u otro logro de llegar a un nivel-m\u00e1ximo), te arriesgas a que la gente del sitio tal vez sientan que el logro no ofrece realmente un reto sino que simplemente es un 'grind-fest'. Logros de este tipo son muy probables que sean dados de baja al menos que tenga un segundo prop\u00f3sito, como en Final Fantasy V donde el hecho escapar de batallas le da energ\u00eda a un arma que se llama 'Chicken Knife'. Esto tiene una SINERGIA con el juego, en comparaci\u00f3n a crear un logro en el que se basa solamente en llegar al x nivel mas alto sin ning\u00fan otro prop\u00f3sito. Logros Basados en Coleccionables link La mayor\u00eda de los logros basados en coleccionables son opcionales, al menos que los items sean MacGuffins, que en ese caso ya cae en Progresi\u00f3n/Colecci\u00f3n. Ejemplos: Encontrar los sombreros de Mickey escondidos para conseguir 1-ups en Aladdin de Genesis. Encontrar items excepcionalmente escondidos. Bestiarios. Desbloquear un personaje opcional. Llegar al M\u00e1ximo de Dinero/Bajas/Habilidades. Encontrar todas las diferentes maneras de morir en juegos como Prince of Persia o Shadowgate. Abrir todos los cofres en un juego/encontrar cada powerup. Todos los items/Coleccionar 99 o 255 (etc.) un \u00edtem en particular. Atrapar todos los Pokemon (cualquier colecci\u00f3n de monstruos, en general.) Si el juego almacena cierta stat/habilidad, los desarrolladores pr\u00e1cticamente te est\u00e1n motivando a que lo maximices. Ahora, podr\u00edas ser ese tipo de jugador, o tal vez no. Eso tienes que pregunt\u00e1rtelo a ti mismo, como un desarrollador, como quieras o no, otros jugadores si podr\u00edan ser capaz de conseguir esas 9999 bajas de murci\u00e9lagos vampiro por ejemplo, incluso si tu no lo hicieras. Las ventajas de esto es que la gente que no lo haria normalmente ahora tiene algo por lo que volver cuando tengan ganas de volver a jugar el juego. La desventaja es que hay otros jugadores que no llegarian tan lejos como para hacerlo, pero tambi\u00e9n sienten que tienen que MASTERIZAR cada juego r\u00e1pidamente (algo un poco raro), al final se van a quejar. Y si consigues bastantes quejas, tal vez quieras dar de baja ese logro de haz 9999 o a algo un poco mas razonable, como 500. Si nadie se divierte haciendo alg\u00fan logro, ese simplemente no es el esp\u00edritu de jugar juegos y de hacer logros. Tienes que utilizar tu criterio y pensar que es lo que el jugador disfrutar\u00eda mas. Como una regla de oro, es mejor tener algunos logros sobre Sidequests/Opcionales que ni siquiera ninguno. Pero con un poco de empe\u00f1o extra, estos logros pueden hacer tu lista mucho mas memorable. Siguiente, a llegado el momento de que nos subamos nuestras mangas como desarrolladores y nos pongamos MUY creativos, hemos llegado cuando el desarrollador reta al jugador a retos que van mucho mas all\u00e1 de las reglas del juego. Logros por Diversi\u00f3n link Este tipo de logros usualmente otorgan solamente algunos puntos, pero siguen siendo divertidos Ejemplos de Por Diversi\u00f3n: Deja que el reloj llega a las 99:59 en Valkyrie Profile. Fondos Interactivos, as\u00ed como el cad\u00e1ver colgando en el stage 1 de Castlevania: Bloodlines. Cocinar el hamster en el micro-ondas en Maniac Mansion. Ver el apocal\u00edpsis en Majora's Mask. Encontrar a John Romero en Doom 2. Algunas veces, los desarrolladores dejan divertidos easter eggs. Ellos se van la milla extra para entrener al jugador con \u00a8que pasar\u00eda si...\u00a8. De nuevo, es nuestro trabajo identificar este tipo de casos y as\u00ed darles soporte como desarrolladores. Retos link Una cosa que tienes que recordar sobre jugadores retro - y los juegos que juegan - es que la mayor\u00eda de las veces nosotros hemos jugado estos juegos un mill\u00f3n de veces anteriormente. Esta es la misma vieja canci\u00f3n y baile para la mayor\u00eda de nosotros, e inclusive a veces necesitamos algo de motivaci\u00f3n para hacerlo de nuevo. Algunos de nosotros hemos terminado Contra sin perder una sola vida. Bueno, a llegado la hora que lo demostremos! A lo que me refiero es que, pi\u00e9nsalo: Antes de este sitio web, la \u00fanica manera de demostrarle a alguien que te pasaste Contra perfectamente era invitar a un amigo para que lo viera, o moverle a un software de grabaci\u00f3n de v\u00eddeo y subir un a YouTube. Pero incluso hay, muchos de esos v\u00eddeos est\u00e1n modificados para que se vean que fue un playthrough perfectos. En cambio, este sitio, cuenta con Hardcore mode, que te ayuda a indicar que nadie esta haciendo trampa. Tal vez ya cuentes con logros de progresi\u00f3n y logros sobre Sidequests/Opcionales, pero si tu quieres crear una lista de logros que sea realmente grandiosa, necesitas al menos algunos logros sobre Retos. Intenta pensar atr\u00e1s a cerca de todos los juegos que haz jugado en este sitio web. Cuales son algunos de los logros mas memorables? Te puedo garantizar que son Logros sobre Retos. Hay excepciones en la regla, claro, pero el jugador tipico no va a realmente recordar un logro sobre, 'Completa el Stage 2-6', o 'Llega al Nivel 30'. Es mas probable que recuerden logros que convirtieron a su playthrough en una experiencia \u00fanica, as\u00ed como... completa todo el juego sin nunca haber recogido un power-up o moneda derrota a un jefe sin nunca haber recibido un golpe completa un stage sin perder una sola vida Esto es lo que hace a este sitio tan especial, y lo que hace a los logros algo mucho mas de simplemente completar el juego. Incluso los jugadores que odian la simple idea de los Logros podr\u00edan decir, \"Bueno, excepto por ESTE. Este si estaba bien.\" y te puedo garantizar que el ejemplo del que ESE ejemplo del que estaban hablando fue un logro sobre un reto, algo que reta al jugador mas all\u00e1 del juego en si. Un buen desarrollador de logros va a mantener sus ojos bien abiertos, y sus sentidos al m\u00e1ximo cuando se trate de desarrollar un juego, buscando buenos e inusuales retos. Tal vez notes algo en el juego que seria una haza\u00f1a bastante complicada y que vale la pena. Retos de Speedruns link Los Timers introducen una presi\u00f3n a los jugadores en sus juegos favoritos que tal vez jamas hubieran sentido. Muy pocas cosas hacen que el coraz\u00f3n se acelere tanto que un reloj haciendo tik-tok. A\u00f1ade un timer, y un juego que era anteriormente tan f\u00e1cil que se poda completar con los ojos cerrados se va a convertir transformar de repente en la prueba jugabilista definitiva de sus vidas. Ejemplos de Retos de Speedruns: Completa un juego en menos de una hora. Completa un nivel en especifico en menos de tres minutos. Completa un nivel antes de que el contador llega a ciertos segundos. Derrota a 30 murci\u00e9lagos vampiro durante la secuencia de escape. Colecciona 99 monedas bonus antes que termine la secuencia bonus. Llega al punto A a el punto B antes de que el d\u00eda cambie a noche. Tabla de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa el juego en el tiempo mas r\u00e1pido posible. Tabla de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa un Stage en el tiempo mas r\u00e1pido posible. Un desarrollador tal vez quiera ir a YouTube o Twitch y ver que tan r\u00e1pido la gente esta terminando un juego (Y por favor ignora v\u00eddeos que utilicen TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Algunos pro speed-runners son muy r\u00e1pidos que el jugador t\u00edpico no tendr\u00eda la posibilidad de lograrlo en ese tiempo establecido, tienes que encontrar una manera que sea un buen balance. Y si no puedes encontrar un buen tiempo el cual retar a los jugadores, para eso est\u00e1n las tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n - Convi\u00e9rtelo en una competici\u00f3n! De hecho, algunos de tus celebridades favoritas del mundo del speedrun podr\u00edan venir a este sitio y meter uno que otro tiempo. Tu sabes cuando un logro te esta metiendo presi\u00f3n cuando te empiezan a sudar las manos y te encuentras nervioso mientras observas y observas el reloj. Como dije anteriormente, nada grita mas fuerte, \"Despierta!\" que un timer, especialmente cuando los desarrolladores empiezan a\u00f1adir este tipo de logros con OTROS tipos de logros (e incluso tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n) durante una secci\u00f3n contrarreloj del juego. Los Retos de Tiempo tienen una sinergia muy grande con otros tipos de logros. Retos de Limitaciones link Ejemplos de Retos con Limitaciones: Completa un combate o inclusive el juego completo solamente con los personajes de cierta clase en especifico. (Un famoso ejemplo es completar Final Fantasy con un grupo de Magos Blancos.) Vence al jefe final sin equipo puesto. Completa un stage sin brincar. Completa un puzzle con solo dos movimientos. One-hit KOs. Low level games (LLGs). Logros sin que te peguen. Nunca presiones cierto bot\u00f3n(es) durante un reto. Nunca pierdas invisibilidad en un nivel completo de Mario 3, encontrando los suficientes Starmen. Derrota a cierto enemigo sin utilizar cierto movimiento. Llega con Ganon en The Legend of Zelda, sin espada. Derreto a cierto enemigo utilizando SOLAMENTE cierto movimiento. Completa un laberinto mientras estas ebrio/confundido. Completa el juego mientra te encuentras en un estado alterado. Sitios web basados en juegos en especifico son un recurso fant\u00e1stico para encontrar estos tipos de logros ellos tienen una muy buena idea de que es posible y que es imposible, e inclusive han asta escrito FAQs discutiendo retos alternos y maneras diferente de jugar el juego. Algunas veces, pasara de que no hay en si una comunidad. No FAQs. No tablas de mensajes. E inclusive tal vez no all\u00e1 v\u00eddeos \u00fatiles. En esos casos, tu necesitas ser una persona con la idea de crear nuevos e interesantes retos para el jugador. Ten en cuenta que ese tipo de logros toman mucha practica, tiempo, y experiencia para ser creados. La clave de esto es que SEAS CREATIVO! Y recuerda mantenerlo DIVERTIDO! Retos de Puntuaci\u00f3n link Ejemplos de Retos de Puntuaci\u00f3n: Completa un juego o un nivel con la puntuaci\u00f3n mas baja posible. Completa un minijuego con la puntuaci\u00f3n perfecta (no simplemente le ganas al CPU en las tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n). Tablas de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa el juego con la puntuaci\u00f3n mas alta/mas dinero/mejor cantidad de bajas/etc. posible. Tablas de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa un nivel en especifico con la puntuaci\u00f3n mas alta/mas dinero/mejor cantidad de bajas/etc. posible. Retos Pros y Contras link Logros sobre retos son tu oportunidad para mostrarle a los jugadores como jugar sus juegos favoritos de una manera diferente, \u00fanica, y inclusive en maneras alucinantes. A pesar de que este tipo de logros le dan un respiro de vida a un set aburrido, tu generalmente solo quieres que una peque\u00f1a parte de este tipo de logros est\u00e9n en tu lista final. Pros link A los jugadores Hardcore les encantan esforzarse en este tipo de logros. Si algunos jugadores son bastante hardcore, puedes encontrar un buen punto medio implementando tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n, que satisface a los dos a la vez al cazador de logros casual y los jugadores hardcore. Esta es tu oportunidad para ponerte bastante creativo y venir con nuevos retos que los jugadores jamas se esperar\u00edan. Esta puede ser una grata sorpresa y podr\u00eda hacer tus listas verdaderamente memorables. Contras link Estos tipos de logros requiere una cantidad justa de creatividad, aunque hay muchas maneras de encontrar maneras inusuales de completar juegos como por ejemplo viendo cosas como speed runs. Podr\u00eda requerir bastante b\u00fasqueda previa. Estos logros son notoriamente complicados de codificar. Estos requieren que hagas bastantes notas de c\u00f3digo, hacer bastante observaciones en las mec\u00e1nicas del juego, e inclusive a veces requieren testear bugs incluso antes que funcionen correctamente. De hecho, tal vez no te encuentres listo para hacer este tipo de logros asta que cuentes con bastantes bastantes sets de logros hechos. Afortunadamente, Logros sobre Retos siempre pueden ser agregados despu\u00e9s.

O no tiene mucho que ver con una trama/historia o algo parecido. En este caso, veamos algunos BUENOS y MALOS ejemplos sobre esto: Bueno: Completa el stage 1. Malo: Llega al stage 2. Toma ligeramente mas trabajo programar un logro donde el jugador necesita completar un stage en vez de simple llegar al siguiente. Pero es aparte mas satisfactorio para el jugador, y se ve mucho mas profesional. Aparte tambi\u00e9n es menos susceptible a problemas donde los jugadores cargan partidas de guardado o estados de guardado (savestates) para logros gratis . Bueno: Completa el juego. Malo: Empieza el juego. Es cierto que los logros basados en progresi\u00f3n son usualmente logros regalados, pero generalmente todos estamos de acuerdo en que un logro sobre empezar el juego es demasiado f\u00e1cil, y no del todo memorable para el jugador. Es simplemente es una norma, sin embargo es muchas veces la parte mas memorable de un juego para el jugador, y completar un juego es definitivamente un logro en si. Es correcto hacer un logro que funcione de la siguiente manera \"Completa el ultimo mundo y completa el juego\". Bueno: Completa los stages con tem\u00e1tica de nieve, Completa los primeros cinco stages, o Completa los primeros diez stages. Malo: Completa el Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (todos los logros por separado) Una de las peores cosas que puedes hacer es spammear logros. Juegos de Puzzle son notorios por tener ese tipo de problemas, porque los stages son cortos y por lo regular, hay cientos o hasta mas. Como resultado, el feed de la pagina principal termina con un mont\u00f3n de micro-actualizaciones, y sacan a los logros de otros usuarios r\u00e1pidamente del feed. La manera de corregir esto de la manera mas profesional posible es espaciar los logros un poco mas, en grupos de stages. Por ejemplo, si los stages 1-10 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica de fuego, y los stages 11-20 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica del espacio, puedes crear logros basados en esas tem\u00e1ticas.

Encontrando que es lo que va a pasar en el futuro en Chrono Trigger. Lanzando la Vaca en Earthworm Jim. Casi cualquier muerte de alg\u00fan personaje. La cosa es de ser extremadamente cuidados con los spoilers. Si encuentras alg\u00fan logro relacionado con historia y cuenta con un spoiler, contacta al desarrollador responsable.

Algunos jugadores en este sitio web son mas casuales y no intentan hacer muchos mas que pasar juegos. No todos sienten la necesidad de Masterizar cada juego en Hardcore mode. Muchos son perfectamente felices agarrando uno que otro logro aparte durante su play-through normal, y no hay nada malo con eso. Algunas escenas son memorables, y merecen sus propio logros! Gente que creci\u00f3 con estos juegos mueren por ver esas escenas en la lista de logros, y tal vez les llegue un poco al coraz\u00f3n cuando vean que ya consiguieron ese logro. Los Logros basados en progresi\u00f3n ayudan a otros usuarios a medir que tan lejos esta un jugador en el juego, un poco como Rich Presence.

En otras palabras, un reto hecho por los desarrolladores. Usualmente son divertidas, o algunas veces no tanto, pero merecen un precio porque requieren de trabajo duro y persistencia para lograrlos.

Con este sitio, ellos pueden mostrarle a sus amigos que si mataron a la 'rana amarilla' que rara vez se ve en el pantano, o encontraron el transportador a la 'dimensi\u00f3n desconocida'. Si incluimos estas curiosidades en nuestras listas de logros, le estamos demostrando a los jugadores que 'estamos informados', que crea confianza en que podemos guiarlos completamente por el juego. Logros de Sidequests/Opcionales le dan a los jugadores algo por lo que esforzarse despu\u00e9s de haber pasado el juego. Estos tipos de logros pueden ser com\u00fanmente conseguidos en cualquier momento. Los jugadores sienten un llegue mas fuerte de endorfinas cuando un logro sale cuando ellos no esperaban conseguirlo, pero se le fue premiado. Estos tipos de logros son por lo general f\u00e1ciles de programar, despu\u00e9s de los logros tipo progresi\u00f3n.","title":"Pros"},{"location":"Achievement-Design-es/#contras_1","text":"A algunos jugadores no les interesa explorar mas all\u00e1 de lo que ofrece el t\u00edpico play-through, as\u00ed que un set con un gran porcentaje de este tipo de logros pueden sentir al jugador como si no se le hubiera premiado lo suficiente. (Por supuesto, este tipo de jugador es un poco raro en un sitio web centrado en logros.) Alguna gente podr\u00eda sentir que un reto en especifico es muy complicado, incluso si es algo que originalmente los desarrolladores incluyeron para que los jugadores lo consigan. Cuando creas un logro de Sidequests/Opcional digamos, por ejemplo, escapa de 999 batallas (u otro logro de llegar a un nivel-m\u00e1ximo), te arriesgas a que la gente del sitio tal vez sientan que el logro no ofrece realmente un reto sino que simplemente es un 'grind-fest'. Logros de este tipo son muy probables que sean dados de baja al menos que tenga un segundo prop\u00f3sito, como en Final Fantasy V donde el hecho escapar de batallas le da energ\u00eda a un arma que se llama 'Chicken Knife'. Esto tiene una SINERGIA con el juego, en comparaci\u00f3n a crear un logro en el que se basa solamente en llegar al x nivel mas alto sin ning\u00fan otro prop\u00f3sito.","title":"Contras"},{"location":"Achievement-Design-es/#logros-basados-en-coleccionables","text":"La mayor\u00eda de los logros basados en coleccionables son opcionales, al menos que los items sean MacGuffins, que en ese caso ya cae en Progresi\u00f3n/Colecci\u00f3n. Ejemplos: Encontrar los sombreros de Mickey escondidos para conseguir 1-ups en Aladdin de Genesis. Encontrar items excepcionalmente escondidos. Bestiarios. Desbloquear un personaje opcional. Llegar al M\u00e1ximo de Dinero/Bajas/Habilidades. Encontrar todas las diferentes maneras de morir en juegos como Prince of Persia o Shadowgate. Abrir todos los cofres en un juego/encontrar cada powerup. Todos los items/Coleccionar 99 o 255 (etc.) un \u00edtem en particular. Atrapar todos los Pokemon (cualquier colecci\u00f3n de monstruos, en general.) Si el juego almacena cierta stat/habilidad, los desarrolladores pr\u00e1cticamente te est\u00e1n motivando a que lo maximices. Ahora, podr\u00edas ser ese tipo de jugador, o tal vez no. Eso tienes que pregunt\u00e1rtelo a ti mismo, como un desarrollador, como quieras o no, otros jugadores si podr\u00edan ser capaz de conseguir esas 9999 bajas de murci\u00e9lagos vampiro por ejemplo, incluso si tu no lo hicieras. Las ventajas de esto es que la gente que no lo haria normalmente ahora tiene algo por lo que volver cuando tengan ganas de volver a jugar el juego. La desventaja es que hay otros jugadores que no llegarian tan lejos como para hacerlo, pero tambi\u00e9n sienten que tienen que MASTERIZAR cada juego r\u00e1pidamente (algo un poco raro), al final se van a quejar. Y si consigues bastantes quejas, tal vez quieras dar de baja ese logro de haz 9999 o a algo un poco mas razonable, como 500. Si nadie se divierte haciendo alg\u00fan logro, ese simplemente no es el esp\u00edritu de jugar juegos y de hacer logros. Tienes que utilizar tu criterio y pensar que es lo que el jugador disfrutar\u00eda mas. Como una regla de oro, es mejor tener algunos logros sobre Sidequests/Opcionales que ni siquiera ninguno. Pero con un poco de empe\u00f1o extra, estos logros pueden hacer tu lista mucho mas memorable. Siguiente, a llegado el momento de que nos subamos nuestras mangas como desarrolladores y nos pongamos MUY creativos, hemos llegado cuando el desarrollador reta al jugador a retos que van mucho mas all\u00e1 de las reglas del juego.","title":"Logros Basados en Coleccionables"},{"location":"Achievement-Design-es/#logros-por-diversion","text":"Este tipo de logros usualmente otorgan solamente algunos puntos, pero siguen siendo divertidos Ejemplos de Por Diversi\u00f3n: Deja que el reloj llega a las 99:59 en Valkyrie Profile.

Algunos de nosotros hemos terminado Contra sin perder una sola vida. Bueno, a llegado la hora que lo demostremos! A lo que me refiero es que, pi\u00e9nsalo: Antes de este sitio web, la \u00fanica manera de demostrarle a alguien que te pasaste Contra perfectamente era invitar a un amigo para que lo viera, o moverle a un software de grabaci\u00f3n de v\u00eddeo y subir un a YouTube.

Tal vez ya cuentes con logros de progresi\u00f3n y logros sobre Sidequests/Opcionales, pero si tu quieres crear una lista de logros que sea realmente grandiosa, necesitas al menos algunos logros sobre Retos. Intenta pensar atr\u00e1s a cerca de todos los juegos que haz jugado en este sitio web. Cuales son algunos de los logros mas memorables? Te puedo garantizar que son Logros sobre Retos. Hay excepciones en la regla, claro, pero el jugador tipico no va a realmente recordar un logro sobre, 'Completa el Stage 2-6', o 'Llega al Nivel 30'. Es mas probable que recuerden logros que convirtieron a su playthrough en una experiencia \u00fanica, as\u00ed como... completa todo el juego sin nunca haber recogido un power-up o moneda derrota a un jefe sin nunca haber recibido un golpe completa un stage sin perder una sola vida Esto es lo que hace a este sitio tan especial, y lo que hace a los logros algo mucho mas de simplemente completar el juego. Incluso los jugadores que odian la simple idea de los Logros podr\u00edan decir, \"Bueno, excepto por ESTE. Este si estaba bien.\" y te puedo garantizar que el ejemplo del que ESE ejemplo del que estaban hablando fue un logro sobre un reto, algo que reta al jugador mas all\u00e1 del juego en si. Un buen desarrollador de logros va a mantener sus ojos bien abiertos, y sus sentidos al m\u00e1ximo cuando se trate de desarrollar un juego, buscando buenos e inusuales retos.

N\u00e3o o lado t\u00e9cnico, mas o lado conceitual. Este conteudo \u00e9 um resumo do que foi originalmente escrito pelo usu\u00e1rio cirellio em um forum . texto em ingl\u00eas Conquistas Baseadas em Progresso link H\u00e1 3 tipos de conquistas baseadas em progresso: progresso simples, progresso baseado na hist\u00f3ria, e conquistas baseadas em progresso/coletagem. Progresso Simples link Conquistas baseadas em Progresso s\u00e3o geralmente mais simples, especialmente se o jogo que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo n\u00e3o passa de fases lineares. Ou n\u00e3o tem muita coisa acontecendo na hist\u00f3ria. Neste caso, vamos dar uma olhadas em alguns exemplos BONS e RUINS disto: Bom: Clear Stage 1. (Conclua o 1 estagio) Ruim: Reach Stage 2. (Chegue o 2 estagio) \u00c9 preciso um pouco mais de trabalho para codificar uma conquista em que o jogador precisa concluir a fase, em vez de simplesmente chegar a pr\u00f3xima. Mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito mais satisfat\u00f3rio para o jogador, e tem muito mais um olhar profissional. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 menos suscet\u00edvel a problemas com jogadores que carregam save games ou savestates para ganhar conquistas em massa Nota do tradutor: Em outras palavras: Evitar Cheats Bom: Complete o jogo. Ruim: Inicie o jogo. Enquanto as conquistas baseadas em progresso s\u00e3o frequentemente brindes, geralmente \u00e9 concordado aqui que uma conquista para come\u00e7ar o jogo \u00e9 um pouco f\u00e1cil demais, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada memor\u00e1vel para o jogador. \u00c9 apenas uma formalidade. E finalizando o jogo, no entanto, \u00e9 frequentemente a parte do jogo mais memor\u00e1vel para um jogador, e completar um jogo \u00e9 definitivamente uma conquista em si. \u00c9 uma boa pr\u00e1tica fazer essas conquistas como \"Derrote o ultimo chefe/fase e conclua o jogo\" Bom: Conclua as fases tem\u00e1ticas de gelo, ou Conclua as cinco primeiras fases, ou Conclua as dez primeiras fases. Ruim: Complete a fase 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (todas as conquistas separadas) Uma das piores coisas que voc\u00ea pode fazer \u00e9 criar spams de conquistas. Jogos de Puzzles s\u00e3o not\u00e1veis por esses tipos de problemas, porque as fases s\u00e3o curtas e existem centenas delas ou mais. Como um resultado, o feed da p\u00e1gina principal fica com muitas micro-atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es, que \"spama\" as conquistas das outras pessoas para baixo e pra fora da p\u00e1gina principal rapidamente. A maneira de se mostrar mais profissional nessa quest\u00e3o \u00e9 ampliar um pouco mais as conquistas, em grupos de fases. Por exemplo, se os est\u00e1gios 1-10 s\u00e3o todas tem\u00e1ticas de fogo, e as fases 11-20 s\u00e3o tem\u00e1ticas de espa\u00e7o sideral, voc\u00ea pode criar conquistas ao redor desses temas. Seja criativo. Progresso Baseado na hist\u00f3ria: link Os momentos mais memor\u00e1veis na hist\u00f3ria dos jogos muitas vezes n\u00e3o est\u00e3o relacionados \u00e0 cole\u00e7\u00e3o de itens ou sidequests, mas para cenas espec\u00edficas relacionadas \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria Exemplos: - O primeiro encontro com Pyramid Head na s\u00e9rie Silent Hill - Encontrar a verdade sobre Darth Revan em Knights of the Old Republic - Encontrar o que ir\u00e1 acontecer no futuro em Chrono Trigger - Lan\u00e7ar a vaca em Earthworm Jim. - Praticamente qualquer morte de personagem. A coisa que voc\u00ea tem que ter cuidado extra \u00e9 com os spoilers. Se voc\u00ea pegar uma conquista baseada em progresso que tem um spoiler, contacte um desenvolvedor sobre isso. E os desenvolvedores, por favor, seja receptivo quando vier cr\u00edticas construtivas! Al\u00e9m disso, o n\u00famero e at\u00e9 a porcentagem deles ir\u00e3o variar de jogo para jogo--E depende muito de como o jogo \u00e9 baseado na hist\u00f3ria. Progresso/Coletagem link Progresso/Coletagem \u00e9 um h\u00edbrido comum. N\u00e3o apenas em voc\u00ea coletar um item, mas tamb\u00e9m inicia uma cena memor\u00e1vel (e obrigat\u00f3ria). Exemplos - Obter a Master Sword em Link to the Past, que sustenta a maldi\u00e7\u00e3o em Lost Woods - Encontrar a espada na praia em Link's Awakening, na primeira cena em que a coruja s\u00e1bia fala com voc\u00ea. - Pegar o seu Pokemon inicial, que acontece durante uma cena inicial, mas \u00e9 um \"ritual de passagem\" para a maioria dos jogadores. Conquistas nesta categoria h\u00edbrida podem oferecer muito mais satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o porquer eles s\u00e3o Conquistas nesta categoria h\u00edbrida geralmente s\u00e3o mais satisfat\u00f3rios pois eles desempenham um papel duplo. O jogador n\u00e3o est\u00e1 apenas pegando um item, mas tamb\u00e9m assistindo uma cena memor\u00e1vel e farturando uma conquista, tudo de uma vez. Que enxurrada de endorfina! Pr\u00f3s e Contras em Progresso link Conquistas em Progresso s\u00e3o garantidos ao jogador em uma jogada normal. Ent\u00e3o, por que t\u00ea-los? Pr\u00f3s link Um jogador merece os pontos por jogar! Fa\u00e7a eles! Lembre, um monte de pessoas estar\u00e3o jogando esses jogos pela primeira vez, e muitos jogos s\u00e3o um pouco dificeis para se zerar. Por que n\u00e3o devemos recompensar os jogadores por uma boa e normal jogada? Pr\u00eamios de progress\u00e3o peri\u00f3dicos ajudam a encorajar os jogadores a completar um jogo. Alguns jogadores s\u00e3o mais casuais e n\u00e3o pretendem fazer muito mais do que zerar jogos neste site. Nem todo mundo sente a necessidade de platinar todos os jogos no modo Hardcore. Muitos ficam perfeitamente felizes em conseguir qualquer conquista que possam ter durante uma jogada normal, e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de errado com isso. Algumas cenas s\u00e3o t\u00e3o memor\u00e1veis que merecem conquistas pr\u00f3prias! As pessoas que cresceram com esses jogos e os amam, tem o costume de procurar essas cenas em listas de conquistas, e isso pode apenas aquecer seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o quando elas perceberem que isso foi reconhecido. Conquistas de progresso ajudam outras pessoas no site a avaliar a dist\u00e2ncia de um jogador em um jogo, parecido com o Estado de Presen\u00e7a . N\u00f3s podemos \"soltar uma linha\" para o jogador e dizer: \"Boa sorte!\" porque sabemos que a pr\u00f3xima parte \u00e9 bem complicada. Encoraja a comunidade a interagir. A ordem importa! Conquistas em Progresso podem nos dizer muito sobre o progresso apenas pela ordem que elas ocorram. Se voc\u00ea ativar aquela conquista de boss opcional e conseguiu um milh\u00e3o de dolares, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo todas as sidequests, isso \u00e9 muito menos impressionante do que se voc\u00ea conseguir tir\u00e1-lo bem antes do meio do jogo. Em outras palavras, conquistas em progresso nos permite mostrar um pouco! Podemos mostrar ao mundo que podemos vencer o chefe final antes de chegarmos ao n\u00edvel 10, ou que podemos finalizar o Expert Mode antes de ir primeiro no Facil e Normal. Pode at\u00e9 revelar se usamos falhas ou truques para pular certas partes do jogo . Ent\u00e3o, como voc\u00ea pode ver, conquistas em progresso tem grande SINERGIA com outros tipos de conquistas. Esses tipos de conquistas s\u00e3o as mais faceis de codificar e s\u00e3o geralmente livres de erros. Contras link Muitas Conquistas em Progresso podem saturar um jogo com 'brindes', e isto \u00e9 uma Coisa Muito Ruim. Se todo o seu jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada alem do que esses tipos de conquistas, entao \u00e9 apenas uma jogatina chata para os jogadores. Chegue a fase 2, Chegue a fase 3, Chegue a fase 4, Complete o Jogo. Estas as uma grande 'base' para voc\u00ea come\u00e7ar a adicionar conquistas de outras categorias, mas n\u00e3o deixe que listas apenas com conquistas em progresso se voc\u00ea pode ajudar com isso. Outra coisa al\u00e9m disso voc\u00ea apenas estar\u00e1 recompensando jogadores por fazer coisa que eles j\u00e1 fizeram um milh\u00e3o de vezes antes. Sidequest/Conquistas Opcionais link Os jogos antigos, por si s\u00f3, oferecem pouco ou nenhum incentivo para zerar um bonus, al\u00e9m de que \u00e9 algo para fazer em um dia chuvoso depois de voc\u00ea ter zerado o jogo. Jogos antigos n\u00e3o tinham conectividade com a Internet. E eles n\u00e3o tinham aspectos sociais al\u00e9m de 2 jogadores, e talvez dizendo a seus amigos da escola que voc\u00ea vencesse alguma coisa. Mas agora, com o Retroachievements.org, nos podemos mostrar seus trof\u00e9is antigos (mesmo que isso nos obrigue a refazer o que provavelmente j\u00e1 fizemos h\u00e1 muitos anos). Estes trof\u00e9is s\u00e3o emblemas de honra. Voc\u00ea pode olhar as conquistas de outros membros e come\u00e7ar a entender o qu\u00e3o longe eles foram, o qu\u00e3o h\u00e1beis eles s\u00e3o. Junto com isso vem o respeito dos outros membros. N\u00f3s socializamos, n\u00f3s parabenizamos uns aos outros por um trabalho bem feito. E n\u00f3s somos uma boa compania. Sidequests link Muitas vezes h\u00e1 coisas que o jogador pode fazer que est\u00e3o confinados \u00e0s regras do jogo, mas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias para complet\u00e1-lo. Em outras palavras, um desafio contruido para o jogo pelos desenvolvedores originais do jogo. Geralmente elas s\u00e3o divertidos, mas merecem ser ganhos porque elas requerem trabalho duro e pesistencia para ganhar. Voc\u00ea tem que caminhar em uma corda bamba bem entre se jogadores dedicados s\u00e3o propensos a fazer algo, vs. se o objetivo \u00e9 estupido. As pessoas ter\u00e3o vis\u00f5es diferentes sobre isso, ent\u00e3o fortale\u00e7a-se. Muitas vezes, esses tipos de conquistas s\u00e3o at\u00e9 Easter Eggs ou coisas que o jogador nunca soube que existiam em toda a sua vida! Muitos jogadores adoram esses tipos de conquistas. Provavelmente porque eles acabam conhecendo algo novo sobre um jogo que eles cresceram jogando, ou talvez por perceber que aquele segredo do jogo que \"s\u00f3 ele conhece\" est\u00e1 sendo suportado aqui. \u00c9 muito importante para n\u00f3s desenvolvedores conhecer MUITO BEM o jogo antes de criar um set de conquistas. Exemplos de Sidequests: Entregando caudas para o Coletor de Caudas em Final Fantasy IV. Encontrar ao dono do Item Insignificante em Earthbound. Entregar o \"Jerky\" para o Rei em Guardia Castle. Fazer a sidequest do Anju em Majora's Mask. Aprender sobre o passado de Wrex em Mass Effect Escoltar Uma pessoa muito Importante em Flashback: The Quest for Identity. Descobrir uma sala secreta. Sidequests s\u00e3o mais frequentemente encontrados em RPGs, mas especialmente nesses dias, sidequests s\u00e3o encontrandas em quase todos os g\u00eaneros. Mantenha seus olhos abertos, jogos de plataforma pode tem uma ou tr\u00eas sidequests. Os jogos da s\u00e9rie Kirby por exemplo, tem muitas salas e \u00e1reas escondidas. Muitas vezes, sidequests acabam com \"ganhando um item\" no qual acaba sendo um hibrido: Sidequest/Coletagem. Conquitas Opcionais link Chefes Opcionais Concluir o desafio de uma dungeon (Que \u00e9 um h\u00edbrido de Sidequest) Completar o Modo Expert (que \u00e9 um h\u00edbrido de progress\u00e3o) Completar um desafio secreto. Conseguir a exce\u00e7\u00e3o de de conseguir pegar um item de um monstro. (Pegar um item raro) Completar o jogo com um personagem opcional. Conseguir uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o alta Conseguir coisas que apenas s\u00e3o desbloqueadas em uma segunda jogatina Modos de jogos que s\u00e3o apenas desbloqueadas em multiplas jogatinas Ver finais opcionais Colocar c\u00f3digos para deixar o jogo mais dificil (Passwords e senhas) Estes s\u00e3o os criadores do jogo esperando que voc\u00ea goste de seu jogo o suficiente para continuar voltando para mais, mesmo depois que esses cr\u00e9ditos terminarem. Eles est\u00e3o tentando recompensar o jogador por completar seu jogo e criar alguma forma de satisfazer uma segunda jogatina. Se os criadores do jogo tem problemas de fazer essas coisas como parte integral do jogo, nos como desenvolvedores de conquistas devemos reconhecer esses desafios e criar conquistas apropriadas para pelo menos alguns deles. Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story s\u00e3o famosos por isso. De fato, muitos jogos fazem isso. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem certeza se o seu jogo tem modos extras ou desafios, tenha certeza de fazer alguma pesquisa e chegar alguns FAQs. Ou perguntar na nossa comunidade, muitos de n\u00f3s somos experts nos jogos que s\u00e3o suportados aqui. Pr\u00f3s e Contras de Sidequests/Opcionais link Conquistas de Sidequests/Opcional fazem complementos fant\u00e1sticos para Conquistas de Progresso. Pr\u00f3s link Isto \u00e9 uma m\u00e3o-na-roda de fazer conquistas. As chances s\u00e3o, uma boa parte das conquistas que voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 fazer ser\u00e3o desta categoria. Todos os jogos tem coisas opcionais para se fazer. Como coletar todas as moedas em uma fase! Ganhar 9 vidas! Criar conquistas com esse tipo de conte\u00fado \u00e9 facil, e recompensar o jogar pela sua dedica\u00e7\u00e3o. Criadores de jogos amam jogadores apreciativos. Eles adoram quando os jogadores se incomodam em procurar fundo em seus jogos, apreciam seu trabalho duro, caso contr\u00e1rio, n\u00e3o ver\u00edamos coisas 'divertidas' escondidas em jogos como Easter Eggs, cenas bonus, etc. Se um criador de jogos recompensa os jogadores por fazer isso, por n\u00f3s n\u00e3o? Nos desenvolvedores devemos reconhecer que o jogador foi al\u00e9m. Os jogadores adoram contar aos seus amigos quando encontram algo incomum e fora do comum em um jogo. Neste site, eles podem mostrar aos seus amigos que eles realmente mataram o 'sapo amarelo' raramente visto no p\u00e2ntano, ou encontar o portal para a 'dimens\u00e3o misteriosa'. Se nos incluimos essas curiosidade em nossa lista de conquistas, n\u00f3s mostramos aos jogadores que estamos \"no conhecimento\" que cria confian\u00e7a de que podemos gui\u00e1-los competentemente atrav\u00e9s do jogo. Conquistas de Sidequests/Opcionais d\u00e3o aos jogadores algo para se esfor\u00e7ar por depois que eles zerarem o jogo. Esses tipos de conquistas podem frequentemente serem ganhados em qualquer tempo e n\u00e3o est\u00e3o em um cronograma programado. Jogadores sentem uma corrida extra de endorfinas quando aparece uma conquista que eles n\u00e3o esperavam, mas foi conquistada. Esses tipos de conquistas s\u00e3o geralmente faceis de fazer, segundo, apenas para conquistas de estilo de progresso Contras link Alguns jogadores n\u00e3o se importam em explorar al\u00e9m de uma jogatina t\u00edpica do que ofecere, ent\u00e3o uma alta porcentagem desses tipos de conquistas em um jogo pode deixar o jogador abaixo da recompensa. (Este tipo de jogador \u00e9 um pouco raro em um site concentrado em conquistas.) Algumas pessoas podem sentir um desafio espec\u00edfico muito dif\u00edcil, mesmo se \u00e9 algo que os desenvolvedores do jogo original incluiram no jogo para os jogadores conseguirem. Quando voc\u00ea cria uma conquista de Sidequest/Opcional para, digamos, fugir de 999 batalhas (ou outras conquistas de maximizar o status), voc\u00ea corre o risco de que as pessoas neste site n\u00e3o sintam que essa conquista em particular ofere\u00e7a um desafio e \u00e9 apenas um grind (grind \u00e9 quando se h\u00e1 repeti\u00e7\u00e3o de uma parte para se ganhar experi\u00eancia). Conquistas como essas podem muito bem acabar sendo envias para o \"N\u00e3o-oficial\", a menos que sirvam a um segundo prop\u00f3sito como em Final Fantasy V quando correr de batalhas pode melhor uma arma chamada 'Chicken Knife'. Isto tem SINERGIA com o jogo, ao contr\u00e1rio de criar uma conquista baseada no aumento de n\u00edvel que n\u00e3o tem utilidade. Conquistas baseadas em coletas link A maioria das conquistas baseadas em coleta s\u00e3o opcionais, a menos que os itens em si sejam MacGuffins, que, nesse caso, cairiam diretamente em Progress\u00e3o / Cole\u00e7\u00e3o. Exemplos: Encontrar os chap\u00e9us de Mickey escondidos no cen\u00e1rio para obter 1 vida em Aladdin (Mega Drive). Encontrar itens excepcionalmente bem escondidos Besti\u00e1rios. Desbloquear um personagem opcional. Maximizar dinheiro / kills / status. Encontrar todas as maneiras diferentes de morrer em jogos como Prince of Persia ou Shadowgate. Abrindo todos os ba\u00fas do tesouro em um jogo / encontrando cada powerup. Todos os itens / Coletando 99 ou 255 (etc.) de um item. Capturando todos os Pokemon (qualquer cole\u00e7\u00e3o de monstros, na verdade.) Se o jogo acompanhar uma estat\u00edstica, o desenvolvedor do jogo est\u00e1 praticamente desafiando voc\u00ea a maximiz\u00e1-lo. Agora, voc\u00ea pode ser esse tipo de jogador, e voc\u00ea pode n\u00e3o ser. Voc\u00ea tem que perguntar a si mesmo, como um desenvolvedor, se os outros jogadores provavelmente obter\u00e3o 9999 mortes de um inimigo, mesmo que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o o fa\u00e7a. As vantagens disso s\u00e3o que as pessoas que normalmente n\u00e3o fazem isso sempre t\u00eam algo para voltar e trabalhar quando sentem vontade de jogar novamente. A desvantagem \u00e9 que outros jogadores que normalmente n\u00e3o ir\u00e3o t\u00e3o longe e talvez n\u00e3o o fa\u00e7a, mas tamb\u00e9m sentem que precisam PLATINAR rapidamente todos os jogos (raros de encontrar), v\u00e3o reclamar. Se voc\u00ea receber reclama\u00e7\u00f5es suficientes, voc\u00ea pode querer reduzir 9999 algo mais razo\u00e1vel, como 500. Se ningu\u00e9m est\u00e1 se divertindo com uma conquista, n\u00e3o \u00e9 no esp\u00edrito de jogar ou fazer uma conquista. Voc\u00ea tem que usar seu melhor julgamento aqui e pensar no que o jogador mais gosta. Como regra geral, \u00e9 melhor ter algumas conquistas paralelos / opcionais do que nenhuma. Mas com um pouco de esfor\u00e7o extra, essas conquistas podem tornar sua lista muito memor\u00e1vel. Em seguida, \u00e9 hora de arrega\u00e7ar as mangas como desenvolvedores e ser REALMENTE criativos quando os pr\u00f3prios desenvolvedores desafiam o jogador al\u00e9m das regras do jogo. Conquistas divertidas link Este tipo de conquistas geralmente vale apenas alguns pontos, mas eles ainda s\u00e3o divertidos Exemplos de divers\u00e3o: Deixando o rel\u00f3gio marcar 99:59 em Valkyrie Profile. Fundos interativos, como cutucar o cad\u00e1ver pendurado no est\u00e1gio 1 de Castlevania: Bloodlines. Cozinhando o hamster no microondas em Maniac Mansion. Assistindo o apocalipse em Majora's Mask. Encontrando John Romero em Doom 2. \u00c0s vezes, criadores de jogos adicionam easter eggs (segredos) divertidos. Para entreter o jogador com 'e se isso estivesse ali?'. Mais uma vez, \u00e9 nosso trabalho, como desenvolvedores, reconhec\u00ea-los e apoi\u00e1-los o m\u00e1ximo que pudermos. Desafios link Uma coisa que voc\u00ea deve lembrar sobre os jogadores retr\u00f4 - e os jogos que eles jogam - \u00e9 que a maioria de n\u00f3s j\u00e1 jogou esses jogos um milh\u00e3o de vezes antes. Esta \u00e9 a mesma velha m\u00fasica e dan\u00e7a para a maioria de n\u00f3s, e muitas vezes precisamos de motiva\u00e7\u00e3o para faz\u00ea-lo novamente. Alguns de n\u00f3s podem terminar o Contra sem perder uma \u00fanica vida. Bem, agora \u00e9 a nossa chance de provar isso! Quero dizer, pense nisso: antes deste site, a \u00fanica maneira de provar que voc\u00ea pode fazer uma corrida impec\u00e1vel de Contra era convidar um amigo, sentar e mostrar a ele, ou descobrir software de grava\u00e7\u00e3o e fazer um v\u00eddeo no YouTube. Mas mesmo assim, muitos desses v\u00eddeos s\u00e3o manipulados para se parecer com jogos perfeitos. Este site, no entanto, tem o modo Hardcore, que ajuda a indicar que ningu\u00e9m est\u00e1 trapaceando. Voc\u00ea pode ter Conquistas progressivas e Sidequest / Conquistas Opcionais, mas se voc\u00ea quiser criar uma lista de conquistas que seja realmente \u00f3tima, voc\u00ea precisa de pelo menos algumas Conquistas de Desafio. Tente pensar em todos os jogos que voc\u00ea jogou aqui neste site. Quais s\u00e3o algumas das realiza\u00e7\u00f5es mais memor\u00e1veis? Eu quase posso garantir que eles eram Conquistas de Desafio. Existem exce\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e0 regra, \u00e9 claro, mas o jogador t\u00edpico n\u00e3o vai se lembrar com carinho, Concluir a fase 2-6', ou 'Chegar ao nivel 30'. Eles s\u00e3o mais propensos a se lembrar com carinho de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es que fizeram de seus jogatinas uma experi\u00eancia \u00fanica, como ... passar o jogo inteiro sem nunca pegar um powerup ou moeda derrotar um chefe sem ser atingido terminar um est\u00e1gio sem perder uma vida Isso \u00e9 o que torna este site t\u00e3o especial, e o que faz das conquistas algo mais do que apenas vencer um jogo. Mesmo os cr\u00edticos mais contundentes que odeiam a id\u00e9ia de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es podem dizer: \"Bem, exceto por este. Esse foi bom\". E eu garanto que UM exemplo de que eles est\u00e3o falando \u00e9 uma conquista de desafio, algo que desafiou o jogador al\u00e9m do pr\u00f3prio jogo. Um bom desenvolvedor de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es manter\u00e1 seus olhos abertos, sua intelig\u00eancia sobre eles e seus sentidos afiados ao desenvolver um jogo, procurando por desafios bons e incomuns. Eles podem perceber algo no jogo que \u00e9 um feito dif\u00edcil. Desafios de Speedrun link Os timers apresentam uma press\u00e3o adicional que os jogadores podem nunca ter sentido antes enquanto jogam seus jogos favoritos. Poucas coisas fazem o cora\u00e7\u00e3o bombear mais do que um rel\u00f3gio imponente. Adicione um elemento de temporizador, e um jogo que anteriormente era t\u00e3o f\u00e1cil que eles poderiam venc\u00ea-lo de olhos vendados poderia de repente ser transformado no maior desafio de jogo de suas vidas. Exemplos de desafios do Speedrun: Concluindo um jogo em menos de uma hora. Limpando um est\u00e1gio espec\u00edfico em menos de tr\u00eas minutos. Passe o temporizador em um certo n\u00famero de segundos. Mate 30 morcegos durante a sequ\u00eancia de fuga. Colete 99 moedas b\u00f4nus antes que a tela b\u00f4nus desapare\u00e7a. V\u00e1 do ponto A ao ponto B antes que o dia mude para a noite. Leaderboard - Complete o jogo com o menor tempo poss\u00edvel. Leaderboard - Complete um determinado est\u00e1gio com o menor tempo poss\u00edvel. Um desenvolvedor pode querer ir ao YouTube ou Twitch e ver o qu\u00e3o r\u00e1pido as pessoas est\u00e3o terminando um jogo (E, por favor, ignore o TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Alguns corredores profissionais de velocidade s\u00e3o t\u00e3o r\u00e1pidos que o jogador t\u00edpico n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 a menor chance de competir, mas voc\u00ea deve ser capaz de encontrar um ponto m\u00e9dio entre o melhor tempo dele e o seu. E se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o consegue descobrir um bom momento para desafiar os jogadores aqui, \u00e9 para isso que os Leaderboards s\u00e3o - Transforme isso em uma competi\u00e7\u00e3o! Na verdade, alguns de seus favoritos speed-runners podem vir a este site e colocar seus tempos. Voc\u00ea saber\u00e1 quando voc\u00ea est\u00e1 enfrentando uma conquista de press\u00e3o quando as palmas das m\u00e3os est\u00e3o suando e voc\u00ea se v\u00ea nervosamente olhando para o cron\u00f4metro. Como eu disse antes, nada grita: \"Aten\u00e7\u00e3o!\" mais alto que um cron\u00f4metro, especialmente quando os desenvolvedores come\u00e7am a tecer esse tipo de conquista com OUTROS tipos de conquistas (e at\u00e9 placares de l\u00edderes) durante uma parte cronometrada de um jogo. Os Desafios Temporizadores t\u00eam uma quantidade insana de sinergia com outros tipos de conquistas. Desafios de Limita\u00e7\u00e3o link Exemplos de Desafios de Limita\u00e7\u00e3o: Limpar uma batalha ou at\u00e9 mesmo um jogo inteiro com todos os personagens de uma classe espec\u00edfica. (Um exemplo famoso disso \u00e9 terminar o Final Fantasy original com um grupo de White Mages.) Derrote um chefe final sem equipamento. Conclua um est\u00e1gio sem nunca saltar. Resolva um quebra-cabe\u00e7a em apenas dois movimentos. One-hit KOs. Jogos de baixo n\u00edvel (LLGs). Nenhuma conquista de sucesso. Nunca aperte em determinado bot\u00e3o durante um desafio. Nunca perca a invencibilidade atrav\u00e9s de uma etapa inteira do Mario 3 encontrando estrelas suficientes. Derrote um certo inimigo sem usar um certo movimento. Alcan\u00e7ando Ganon em Legend of Zelda, sem espada. Derrote um certo inimigo SOMENTE usando um certo movimento. Trope\u00e7ar no caminho atrav\u00e9s de um labirinto, enquanto b\u00eabado / confuso. Limpe o jogo com uma doen\u00e7a no status. Os sites da comunidade constru\u00eddos em torno de determinados jogos s\u00e3o um recurso fant\u00e1stico para esses tipos de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es. Eles ter\u00e3o uma boa id\u00e9ia sobre o que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel e imposs\u00edvel, e provavelmente escreveram perguntas frequentes discutindo maneiras alternativas e desafiadoras de jogar o jogo inteiro. Muitas vezes, por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o haver\u00e1 comunidade. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 perguntas frequentes. Nenhum quadro de mensagens. E talvez nem v\u00eddeos \u00fateis. Nesses casos, voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 ser uma pessoa de ideias para criar maneiras novas e interessantes de desafiar o jogador. Esteja ciente de que esse tipo de conquista requer muita pr\u00e1tica, tempo e experi\u00eancia para criar. O jeito aqui \u00e9 ser criativo! E lembre-se de mant\u00ea-lo divertido! Desafios de pontua\u00e7\u00e3o link Exemplos de desafios de pontua\u00e7\u00e3o: Completando um jogo ou n\u00edvel com a menor pontua\u00e7\u00e3o poss\u00edvel. Complete um minigame com uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o perfeita (n\u00e3o apenas no topo do ranking da CPU). Leaderboard - Complete o jogo com a maior pontua\u00e7\u00e3o / mais dinheiro / melhor contagem de mortes / etc. poss\u00edvel. Leaderboard - Complete um estagio com a maior pontua\u00e7\u00e3o / mais dinheiro / melhor contagem de mortes / etc. poss\u00edvel. Pr\u00f3s e Contras dos desafios link As conquistas de desafio s\u00e3o a sua chance de mostrar aos jogadores como jogar seus jogos favoritos de maneiras diferentes, \u00fanicas e at\u00e9 alucinantes. Embora essas conquistas possam dar vida a um conjunto de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es que, de outra forma, \u00e9 mon\u00f3tono, voc\u00ea geralmente quer que apenas um pequeno grupo delas esteja na sua lista final. Pr\u00f3s Jogadores hardcore amam deixar suas marcas nesses tipos de conquistas. Se alguns jogadores s\u00e3o muito hardcore, voc\u00ea pode encontrar um meio feliz implementando o Leaderboards, que satisfaz tanto os ca\u00e7adores de conquistas ocasionais quanto os jogadores hardcore de uma s\u00f3 vez. Esta \u00e9 a sua chance de ser muito criativo e criar novos desafios para jogadores que eles nunca esperaram. Isso pode ser uma surpresa agrad\u00e1vel e realmente tornar suas listas memor\u00e1veis. Contras Esses tipos de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es exigem uma boa quantidade de criatividade, embora haja muitas maneiras de pesquisar, maneiras incomuns de jogar, observando coisas como corridas de velocidade. Pode exigir uma pesquisa profunda. Estes podem ser notoriamente dif\u00edceis de codificar. Eles exigem que voc\u00ea fa\u00e7a muitas anota\u00e7\u00f5es de c\u00f3digo, fa\u00e7a toneladas de observa\u00e7\u00f5es mec\u00e2nicas do jogo e, muitas vezes, eles exigem testes de erros antes mesmo de funcionar. Na verdade, voc\u00ea pode nem estar pronto para enfrentar conquistas como essa at\u00e9 ter alguns jogos em seu curr\u00edculo com um conjunto de conquistas b\u00e1sicas. Felizmente, as Conquistas do Desafio sempre podem ser adicionadas mais tarde.

Ou n\u00e3o tem muita coisa acontecendo na hist\u00f3ria. Neste caso, vamos dar uma olhadas em alguns exemplos BONS e RUINS disto: Bom: Clear Stage 1. (Conclua o 1 estagio) Ruim: Reach Stage 2. (Chegue o 2 estagio) \u00c9 preciso um pouco mais de trabalho para codificar uma conquista em que o jogador precisa concluir a fase, em vez de simplesmente chegar a pr\u00f3xima. Mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito mais satisfat\u00f3rio para o jogador, e tem muito mais um olhar profissional. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 menos suscet\u00edvel a problemas com jogadores que carregam save games ou savestates para ganhar conquistas em massa Nota do tradutor: Em outras palavras: Evitar Cheats Bom: Complete o jogo. Ruim: Inicie o jogo. Enquanto as conquistas baseadas em progresso s\u00e3o frequentemente brindes, geralmente \u00e9 concordado aqui que uma conquista para come\u00e7ar o jogo \u00e9 um pouco f\u00e1cil demais, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada memor\u00e1vel para o jogador. \u00c9 apenas uma formalidade.

Jogos de Puzzles s\u00e3o not\u00e1veis por esses tipos de problemas, porque as fases s\u00e3o curtas e existem centenas delas ou mais. Como um resultado, o feed da p\u00e1gina principal fica com muitas micro-atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es, que \"spama\" as conquistas das outras pessoas para baixo e pra fora da p\u00e1gina principal rapidamente. A maneira de se mostrar mais profissional nessa quest\u00e3o \u00e9 ampliar um pouco mais as conquistas, em grupos de fases. Por exemplo, se os est\u00e1gios 1-10 s\u00e3o todas tem\u00e1ticas de fogo, e as fases 11-20 s\u00e3o tem\u00e1ticas de espa\u00e7o sideral, voc\u00ea pode criar conquistas ao redor desses temas.

Alguns jogadores s\u00e3o mais casuais e n\u00e3o pretendem fazer muito mais do que zerar jogos neste site. Nem todo mundo sente a necessidade de platinar todos os jogos no modo Hardcore. Muitos ficam perfeitamente felizes em conseguir qualquer conquista que possam ter durante uma jogada normal, e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de errado com isso. Algumas cenas s\u00e3o t\u00e3o memor\u00e1veis que merecem conquistas pr\u00f3prias! As pessoas que cresceram com esses jogos e os amam, tem o costume de procurar essas cenas em listas de conquistas, e isso pode apenas aquecer seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o quando elas perceberem que isso foi reconhecido. Conquistas de progresso ajudam outras pessoas no site a avaliar a dist\u00e2ncia de um jogador em um jogo, parecido com o Estado de Presen\u00e7a . N\u00f3s podemos \"soltar uma linha\" para o jogador e dizer: \"Boa sorte!\" porque sabemos que a pr\u00f3xima parte \u00e9 bem complicada. Encoraja a comunidade a interagir. A ordem importa! Conquistas em Progresso podem nos dizer muito sobre o progresso apenas pela ordem que elas ocorram. Se voc\u00ea ativar aquela conquista de boss opcional e conseguiu um milh\u00e3o de dolares, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo todas as sidequests, isso \u00e9 muito menos impressionante do que se voc\u00ea conseguir tir\u00e1-lo bem antes do meio do jogo. Em outras palavras, conquistas em progresso nos permite mostrar um pouco! Podemos mostrar ao mundo que podemos vencer o chefe final antes de chegarmos ao n\u00edvel 10, ou que podemos finalizar o Expert Mode antes de ir primeiro no Facil e Normal. Pode at\u00e9 revelar se usamos falhas ou truques para pular certas partes do jogo . Ent\u00e3o, como voc\u00ea pode ver, conquistas em progresso tem grande SINERGIA com outros tipos de conquistas.

Not the technical side but the conceptual. This content is a summary of what was originally written by RA user cirellio on a forum topic . Progression Based Achievements link There are 3 types of progression based achievements: simple progression, story-based progression, and progression/collection achievements. Simple Progression link Progression-based achievements are usually simplest ones, especially if the game you are doing is nothing but linear stages. Or doesn't have much going on in the way of storylines. In this case, let's look at some GOOD and BAD examples of this: Good: Clear stage 1. Bad: Reach stage 2. It takes slightly more work to code an achievement where the player is required to clear the stage rather than simply reach the next one. But it is also much more satisfying for the player, and it is much more professional-looking. It is also less susceptible to problems with players loading save games or savestates for freebie achievements en masse . Good: Complete the game. Bad: Start the game. While it is true progression-based achievements are often freebies, it is generally agreed upon here that an achievement to start the game is a bit too easy, and not at all memorable for the player. It's just a formality. The ending of the game, however, is often the most memorable part of a game for a player, and completing a game is definitely an achievement in itself. It's a good practice to make such achievement work like \"Beat last stage and beat the game\". Good: Cleared the ice theme stages, or Cleared the first five stages, or Cleared the first ten stages. Bad: Complete Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (all separate achievements) One of the worst things you can do is create achievement spam. Puzzle games are notorious for these kinds of problems, because the stages are short and often, there are one-hundred of them or more. As a result, the main page feed ends up with a lot of micro-updates, which spams other folks' achievements down and off the front page quickly. The way to come off as more professional in this matter is to space out the achievements a bit more, into groups of stages. For instance, if stages 1-10 are all fire themed, and stages 11-20 are all outer-space themed, you can create achievements around these themes. Be creative. Story Based Progression: link The most memorable moments in gaming history are often not related to item collection or sidequests, but to specific scenes relating to the story. Examples: First encounter with Pyramid Head in the Silent Hill series. Finding out the truth about Darth Revan in Knights of the Old Republic. Finding out what will happen in the future in Chrono Trigger. Launching the Cow in Earthworm Jim. Pretty much any character death. The thing you have to be extra-careful with here is spoilers. If you catch a progression-based achievement that has a spoiler in it, by all means contact the dev about it. And devs, please be receptive when it comes to constructive criticism! Also, the number and even percentage of these will vary from game to game--The dependance lies heavily upon how story-driven the game is. Progression/Collection link Progression/Collection is a common hybrid. Not only are you collecting an item, but it also launches into a memorable (and mandatory) scene. Examples: Obtaining the Master Sword in Link to the Past, which lifts the curse in the Lost Woods. Finding the sword on the beach in Link's Awakening, which launches into the first scene where the wise owl speaks to you. Picking your starter Pokemon, which happens during a beginning scene, but is a 'rite of passage' for most gamers. Achievements in this hybrid category are often more satisfying because they are pulling double-duty. The player is not only obtaining an item, but watching a memorable scene and nabbing an achievement all at once. Quite the rush of endorphins! Progression Pros and Cons link Progression Achievements are guaranteed to the player on a normal play-through. So why even have them? Pros link A player deserves points for playing through a game! They do! Remember, a lot of folks are playing through these games for the very first time, and most games are quite hard to beat. Why shouldn't we reward players for a good ol' normal play-through? Periodic progression awards go a long way to encourage players to complete a game. Some players are more casual and don't intend to do much more than beat games on this website. Not everyone feels the need to Master every game in Hardcore mode. Many are perfectly happy grabbing whatever convenient side-achievements they can during a normal play-through, and there's nothing wrong with that. Some scenes are so memorable, they deserve achievements all their own! People who grew up with these games and love them look for these scenes in achievement lists, and it might just warm their heart when they see it was acknowledged. Progression Achievements help other people on the website gauge how far along a player is in a game, a bit like Rich Presence. We can drop a line to the player and say, \"Good luck!\" because we know the next section is pretty tricky. It encourages the community to interact. Order matters! Progression Achievements can tell us a lot about a play-through just by the order they occurred. If you pop that optional boss achievement and saved up a million dollars AFTER you've already done all the sidequests, that's much less impressive than if you manage to pull it off well before the mid-point of the game. In other words, Progression Achievements allow us to show-off a bit! We can show the world that we can beat that final boss before we've reached level 10, or that we can beat Expert mode on our first go before Easy and Normal. It can even reveal if we've used glitches or cheats to skip certain portions of the game . So, as you can see, Progression Achievements have great SYNERGY with other kinds of achievements. These kinds of achievements are the easiest to code and are generally error-free. Cons link Too many Progression Achievements can over-saturate a game with 'freebies', and that's a Very Bad Thing. If your entire game has nothing but these kinds of achievements, it's just another boring run through the game for players. Reach stage 2, Reach stage 3, Reach stage 4, Complete the Game. This is a great 'base' for you to start adding achievements from the other categories, but don't leave your list at just Progression Achievements if you can help it. Otherwise you're just rewarding players full points for going through the motions like they've done a million times before. Sidequest/Optional Achievements link Vintage games, on their own, offer little-to-no incentive to beat a bonus mode, other than that it's something to do on a rainy day after you've beaten the game. Old games didn't have internet connectivity. And they had no social aspects other than 2-player mode, and maybe telling your friends at school that you beat something. But now, with RetroAchievements.org, we can display our vintage trophies (even though it requires us to redo what we've probably already done many years ago). These trophies are badges of honor. You can look at another member's Challenge Achievements and begin to understand how far they went, how skilled they are. Along with that comes respect from the other members. We socialize, we congratulate each other on a job well done. We feel like we belong, and we are in good company. Sidequests link There are often things the player can do that are confined to the rules of the game, but aren't necessary to complete it. In other words, a challenge built into the game by the original game developers. Usually they are fun, or sometimes not so fun, but deserve an award because they require hard work and persistence to achieve. You have to walk a fine tightrope between if dedicated players are likely to do something, vs. if the goal is stupid. People will have differing views over this, so steel yourself. Often times, these types of achievements are even Easter Eggs or things the player never knew existed in their entire lives! Many players adore these types of achievements. I think it's because they learn something new about a game they grew up with, or feel like maybe they were the only ones who knew about a given secret and were excited to see it supported here. It's important for us developers to REALLY know a game inside-and-out before creating an achievement set. Examples of Sidequests: Delivering tails to the Tail Collector in Final Fantasy IV. Finding the owner of the Insignificant Item in Earthbound. Giving the Jerky to the King in Guardia Castle. Anju sidequest in Majora's Mask. Learning about Wrex's past in Mass Effect. Diplomat/VIP escort missions in Flashback: The Quest for Identity. Discovering a secret room. Sidequests are most often found in RPGs, but especially these days, sidequests are finding their way into just about every genre. Keep your eyes peeled - Even the unsuspecting platformer may have a sidequest or three. The Kirby series, for instance, has many hidden rooms and areas. Often times, sidequests end up awarding an item, which falls under a hybrid: Sidequest/Collection. Optional Achievements link Examples of Optional Achievements: Optional bosses. Clearing a challenge dungeon (which is a hybrid of Sidequest). Completing Expert Mode (which is a hybrid of Progression). Completing a secret challenge level. Getting an exceptionally rare drop off of a monster. Clearing the game with an optional character. Getting a high score. Completing features only unlocked on a second playthrough. Game modes that are only unlocked on multiple playthroughs. Optional game endings. Codes you can enter during the title screen to make the game harder. This is the game makers hoping you'll like their game enough to keep coming back for more, even after those ending credits scroll by. They are trying to reward the player for completing their game, and create some form of satisfying re-playability. If the game makers went to the trouble making things like this an integral part of the game, we as achievement developers should recognize these challenges and create appropriate achievements for at least a few of them. Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story are famous for this. The Game Boy Advance Castlevania entries also do this. In fact, many games do this. If you aren't sure if your game has any extra modes or challenges, be sure to do some research and check out some FAQs. Or ask the community here, many of us are experts on the games supported here. Sidequest/Optional Pros and Cons link Sidequest/Optional Achievements make fantastic supplements to Progression Achievements. Pros link This is the bread-and-butter of achievement making. Chances are, a good deal of your achievements will come from this category. All games have optional things to do. Collect all the coins in a stage! Gain 9 lives! Creating achievements for this stuff is easy, and it rewards the player for their dedication. Game makers love appreciative players. They like it when players bother to dig deeper into their games, appreciating their hard work, otherwise we wouldn't see hidden 'fun' things in games like Easter Eggs, bonus scenes, etc. If game makers reward the players for doing it, why shouldn't we? Us devs should also recognize that the player has gone the extra mile. Game players love telling their friends when they find something unusual and off the beaten path in a game. With this site, they can show their friends that they did indeed slay the elusive 'yellow frog' rarely seen in the marsh, or found the warp to the 'mystery dimension'. If we include these curiosities in our achievement lists, we show the players that we are 'in the know', which builds confidence that we can competently guide them through the game. Sidequest/Optional Achievements give players something to strive for after they've beaten the game. These kinds of achievements can often be earned at any time and are not on a predictable schedule. Players feel an extra rush of endorphins when an achievement pops that they weren't expecting, but it was earned. These kinds of achievements are usually easy to code, second only to progression-style achievements. Cons link Some players don't care to explore beyond what a typical play-through has to offer, so a high percentage of these types of achievements in a game can leave a player under-rewarded. (Granted, this type of gamer is a bit of a rare bird on a website centered around achievements.) Some people may feel a specific challenge is too hard, even if it's something the original game developers included in-game for players to achieve. When you create a Sidequest/Optional Achievement for, say, running away from 999 battles (or other stat-maxing achievements), you risk that the people on this website may not feel this particular achievement offers a challenge and is just a 'grind-fest'. Achievements like this may very well end up getting demoted unless they serve a second purpose, like in Final Fantasy V where running away from battles actually powers up a weapon called the 'Chicken Knife'. This has SYNERGY with the game, as opposed to creating an achievement based upon raising a stat that has no other use. Collection Based Achievements link Most collection-based achievements are optional, unless the items themselves are MacGuffins, which in that case they would fall squarely under Progression/Collection. Examples: Finding the Mickey hats hidden in the background to obtain 1-ups in Genesis Aladdin. Finding exceptionally well-hidden items. Bestiaries. Unlocking an optional character. Maxing out Money/kills/stats. Finding all the different ways to die in games like Prince of Persia or Shadowgate. Opening every treasure chest in a game/finding every powerup. All items/Collecting 99 or 255 (etc.) of an item. Catching them all in Pokemon (any monster collection, really.) If the game keeps track of a stat, the game developer is practically daring you to max it out. Now you might be that kind of player, and you might not. You have to ask yourself, as a dev, whether or not other players are likely to get 9999 vampire bat kills, even if you wouldn't. The advantages to this are that people who wouldn't normally do this always have something to come back and work for when they feel like playing the game again. The disadvantage is that other players who wouldn't normally go that far and never would, but also feel like they have to MASTER every game quickly (a rare breed), will complain. If you get enough complaints, you might want to bring down that 9999 to something more reasonable, like 500. If no one's having fun with an achievement, it's not in the spirit of playing games or making achievements. You have to use your better judgment here and think of what the player would enjoy the most. As a rule of thumb, it's better to have a few Sidequest/Optional Achievements than none at all. But with a little extra effort, these achievements can make your list very memorable. Next, it's time to roll up our sleeves as devs and get REALLY creative when the devs themselves challenge the player beyond the rules of the game. For-Fun achievements link This kind of achievements usually worths just a few points, but they are still fun Examples of For Fun: Letting the clock hit 99:59 in Valkyrie Profile. Interactive backgrounds, such as poking the hanging dead body in stage 1 of Castlevania: Bloodlines. Cooking the hamster in the microwave in Maniac Mansion. Watching the apocalypse in Majora's Mask. Finding John Romero in Doom 2. Sometimes, game makers add fun easter eggs. They went the extra mile to entertain the player with 'what if's'. Again, it is our job as devs to recognize and support these as much as we can. Challenges link One thing that you have to remember about retro gamers - and the games they play - is that most of us have played these games a million times before. This is the same old song and dance for most of us, and we often need motivation to do it again. Some of us can clear Contra without losing a single life. Well, now is our chance to prove it! I mean, think about it: Before this website, about the only way to prove you can do a flawless run of Contra was to invite a friend over, sit him down, and show him, or figure out recording software and make a YouTube video. But even then, a lot of those videos are doctored to look like flawless playthroughs. This site, however, has Hardcore mode, which help to indicate no one is cheating. You may have Progression Achievements and Sidequest/Optional Achievements, but if you want to create an achievement list that's truly great, you need at least a few Challenge Achievements. Try to think back to all the games you've played here at this website. What are some of the most memorable achievements? I can almost guarantee you that they were Challenge Achievements. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the typical player isn't going to fondly recall, 'Cleared Stage 2-6', or 'Reached Level 30'. They are more likely to fondly remember achievements that made their play-throughs a unique experience, such as... get through the entire game without ever picking up a powerup or coin defeat a boss without getting hit finish a stage without losing a life That is what makes this website so special, and what makes achievements something more than just beating a game. Even the most vocal critics who hate the idea of Achievements may say, \"Well, except for THIS one. This one was okay.\" And I guarantee you that ONE example they're talking about is a Challenge Achievement, something that challenged the player beyond the game itself. A good achievement developer will keep their eyes peeled, their wits about them, and their senses sharp when developing a game, looking for good, unusual challenges. They may notice something in the game that's a difficult feat. Speedrun Challenges link Timers introduce an added pressure players may have never felt before while playing their favorite games. Few things get the heart pumping more than an imposing ticking clock. Add a timer element, and a game that was previously so easy they could beat it blindfolded could suddenly be transformed into the ultimate gaming challenge of their lives. Examples of Speedrun Challenges: Completing a game in under one hour. Clearing a specific stage in under three minutes. Undercut the timer by a certain number of seconds. Kill 30 vampire bats during the escape sequence. Collect 99 bonus coins before the bonus screen fades away. Go from point A to point B before day changes to night. Leaderboard - Complete the game with the fastest time possible. Leaderboard - Complete a given stage with the fastest time possible. A dev may want to head out to YouTube or Twitch and see how fast people are finishing a game (And please ignore TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Some pro speed-runners are so fast, the typical player here won't stand a chance at the times being posted, but you should be able to find a happy medium. And if you can't figure out a good time to challenge the players here, that's what Leaderboards are for - Turn it into a competition! In fact, some of your favorite celebrity speed-runners may come to this very site and submit a time or two. You'll know when you're facing a pressure achievement when your palms are sweating and you find yourself nervously glancing at the timer. Like I said before, nothing screams, \"Wake up!\" louder than a timer, especially when developers start weaving this kind of achievement with OTHER kinds of achievements (and even leaderboards) during a timed portion of a game. Timer Challenges have an insane amount of synergy with other types of achievements. Limitation Challenges link Examples of Limitation Challenges: Clear a battle or even an entire game with all characters of a specific job class. (One famous example of this is clearing the original Final Fantasy with a group of White Mages.) Beat a final boss with no equipment on. Clear a stage without ever jumping. Solve a puzzle in only two moves. One-hit KOs. Low level games (LLGs). No hit achievements. Never hit certain button(s) during a challenge. Never lose invincibility through an entire Mario 3 stage by finding enough Starmen. Defeat a certain enemy without using a certain move. Reaching Ganon in Legend of Zelda, sword-less. Defeat a certain enemy ONLY using a certain move. Stumble your way through a maze while drunk/confused. Clear the game with a status ailment. Community websites built around certain games are a fantastic resource for these kinds of achievements They'll have a good idea about what's possible and impossible, and have likely written up FAQs discussing alternative and challenging ways to play the entire game. Often times, though, there will be no community. No FAQs. No Message Board. And maybe even no useful videos. In these cases, you'll need to be an idea person to come up with new and interesting ways to challenge the player. Be aware that these kinds of achievements take a lot of practice, time, and experience to create. The takeaway here is to BE CREATIVE! And remember to keep it FUN! Score Challenges link Examples of Score Challenges: Completing a game or level with the lowest possible score. Complete a minigame with a perfect score (not just topping the CPU leaderboard). Leaderboard - Complete the game with the highest score/most money/best kill count/etc. possible. Leaderboard - Complete a given stage with the highest score/most money/best kill count/etc. possible. Challenge Pros and Cons link Challenge Achievements are your chance to show players how to play their favorite games in different, unique, and even mind-bending ways. While these achievements can breathe life into an otherwise dull achievement set, you generally only want a small handful of these to be in your final list. Pros link Hardcore players love sinking their teeth into these kinds of achievements. If some players are too hardcore, you can find a happy medium by implementing Leaderboards, which satisfies both the casual achievement hunters and the hardcore players all at once. This is your chance to be very creative and come up with new challenges for players they never expected. This can be a pleasant surprise and really make your lists memorable. Cons link These types of achievements require a fair amount of creativity to dream up, though there are many ways to research unusual ways to play games by watching things like speed runs. May require a deep research. These can be notoriously difficult to code. They require you to make a lot of code notes, make tons of game mechanic observations, and often times they require bug testing before they even work. In fact, you may not even be ready to tackle achievements like this until you've had a few games under your belt with a set of baseline achievements. Fortunately, Challenge Achievements can always be added later.

I think it's because they learn something new about a game they grew up with, or feel like maybe they were the only ones who knew about a given secret and were excited to see it supported here. It's important for us developers to REALLY know a game inside-and-out before creating an achievement set. Examples of Sidequests: Delivering tails to the Tail Collector in Final Fantasy IV. Finding the owner of the Insignificant Item in Earthbound. Giving the Jerky to the King in Guardia Castle. Anju sidequest in Majora's Mask. Learning about Wrex's past in Mass Effect. Diplomat/VIP escort missions in Flashback: The Quest for Identity. Discovering a secret room. Sidequests are most often found in RPGs, but especially these days, sidequests are finding their way into just about every genre. Keep your eyes peeled - Even the unsuspecting platformer may have a sidequest or three. The Kirby series, for instance, has many hidden rooms and areas. Often times, sidequests end up awarding an item, which falls under a hybrid: Sidequest/Collection.","title":"Sidequests"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#optional-achievements","text":"Examples of Optional Achievements: Optional bosses. Clearing a challenge dungeon (which is a hybrid of Sidequest). Completing Expert Mode (which is a hybrid of Progression). Completing a secret challenge level. Getting an exceptionally rare drop off of a monster. Clearing the game with an optional character. Getting a high score. Completing features only unlocked on a second playthrough. Game modes that are only unlocked on multiple playthroughs. Optional game endings. Codes you can enter during the title screen to make the game harder. This is the game makers hoping you'll like their game enough to keep coming back for more, even after those ending credits scroll by. They are trying to reward the player for completing their game, and create some form of satisfying re-playability. If the game makers went to the trouble making things like this an integral part of the game, we as achievement developers should recognize these challenges and create appropriate achievements for at least a few of them. Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story are famous for this. The Game Boy Advance Castlevania entries also do this. In fact, many games do this. If you aren't sure if your game has any extra modes or challenges, be sure to do some research and check out some FAQs. Or ask the community here, many of us are experts on the games supported here.","title":"Optional Achievements"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#sidequestoptional-pros-and-cons","text":"Sidequest/Optional Achievements make fantastic supplements to Progression Achievements.","title":"Sidequest/Optional Pros and Cons"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#pros_1","text":"This is the bread-and-butter of achievement making. Chances are, a good deal of your achievements will come from this category. All games have optional things to do. Collect all the coins in a stage! Gain 9 lives! Creating achievements for this stuff is easy, and it rewards the player for their dedication. Game makers love appreciative players. They like it when players bother to dig deeper into their games, appreciating their hard work, otherwise we wouldn't see hidden 'fun' things in games like Easter Eggs, bonus scenes, etc. If game makers reward the players for doing it, why shouldn't we? Us devs should also recognize that the player has gone the extra mile. Game players love telling their friends when they find something unusual and off the beaten path in a game. With this site, they can show their friends that they did indeed slay the elusive 'yellow frog' rarely seen in the marsh, or found the warp to the 'mystery dimension'. If we include these curiosities in our achievement lists, we show the players that we are 'in the know', which builds confidence that we can competently guide them through the game. Sidequest/Optional Achievements give players something to strive for after they've beaten the game. These kinds of achievements can often be earned at any time and are not on a predictable schedule. Players feel an extra rush of endorphins when an achievement pops that they weren't expecting, but it was earned. These kinds of achievements are usually easy to code, second only to progression-style achievements.","title":"Pros"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#cons_1","text":"Some players don't care to explore beyond what a typical play-through has to offer, so a high percentage of these types of achievements in a game can leave a player under-rewarded. (Granted, this type of gamer is a bit of a rare bird on a website centered around achievements.) Some people may feel a specific challenge is too hard, even if it's something the original game developers included in-game for players to achieve. When you create a Sidequest/Optional Achievement for, say, running away from 999 battles (or other stat-maxing achievements), you risk that the people on this website may not feel this particular achievement offers a challenge and is just a 'grind-fest'. Achievements like this may very well end up getting demoted unless they serve a second purpose, like in Final Fantasy V where running away from battles actually powers up a weapon called the 'Chicken Knife'. This has SYNERGY with the game, as opposed to creating an achievement based upon raising a stat that has no other use.","title":"Cons"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#collection-based-achievements","text":"Most collection-based achievements are optional, unless the items themselves are MacGuffins, which in that case they would fall squarely under Progression/Collection. Examples: Finding the Mickey hats hidden in the background to obtain 1-ups in Genesis Aladdin. Finding exceptionally well-hidden items. Bestiaries. Unlocking an optional character. Maxing out Money/kills/stats. Finding all the different ways to die in games like Prince of Persia or Shadowgate. Opening every treasure chest in a game/finding every powerup. All items/Collecting 99 or 255 (etc.) of an item. Catching them all in Pokemon (any monster collection, really.) If the game keeps track of a stat, the game developer is practically daring you to max it out. Now you might be that kind of player, and you might not. You have to ask yourself, as a dev, whether or not other players are likely to get 9999 vampire bat kills, even if you wouldn't. The advantages to this are that people who wouldn't normally do this always have something to come back and work for when they feel like playing the game again. The disadvantage is that other players who wouldn't normally go that far and never would, but also feel like they have to MASTER every game quickly (a rare breed), will complain. If you get enough complaints, you might want to bring down that 9999 to something more reasonable, like 500. If no one's having fun with an achievement, it's not in the spirit of playing games or making achievements. You have to use your better judgment here and think of what the player would enjoy the most. As a rule of thumb, it's better to have a few Sidequest/Optional Achievements than none at all. But with a little extra effort, these achievements can make your list very memorable. Next, it's time to roll up our sleeves as devs and get REALLY creative when the devs themselves challenge the player beyond the rules of the game.","title":"Collection Based Achievements"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#for-fun-achievements","text":"This kind of achievements usually worths just a few points, but they are still fun Examples of For Fun: Letting the clock hit 99:59 in Valkyrie Profile. Interactive backgrounds, such as poking the hanging dead body in stage 1 of Castlevania: Bloodlines. Cooking the hamster in the microwave in Maniac Mansion. Watching the apocalypse in Majora's Mask. Finding John Romero in Doom 2. Sometimes, game makers add fun easter eggs. They went the extra mile to entertain the player with 'what if's'. Again, it is our job as devs to recognize and support these as much as we can.","title":"For-Fun achievements"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#challenges","text":"One thing that you have to remember about retro gamers - and the games they play - is that most of us have played these games a million times before. This is the same old song and dance for most of us, and we often need motivation to do it again. Some of us can clear Contra without losing a single life. Well, now is our chance to prove it! I mean, think about it: Before this website, about the only way to prove you can do a flawless run of Contra was to invite a friend over, sit him down, and show him, or figure out recording software and make a YouTube video. But even then, a lot of those videos are doctored to look like flawless playthroughs. This site, however, has Hardcore mode, which help to indicate no one is cheating. You may have Progression Achievements and Sidequest/Optional Achievements, but if you want to create an achievement list that's truly great, you need at least a few Challenge Achievements. Try to think back to all the games you've played here at this website. What are some of the most memorable achievements? I can almost guarantee you that they were Challenge Achievements. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the typical player isn't going to fondly recall, 'Cleared Stage 2-6', or 'Reached Level 30'. They are more likely to fondly remember achievements that made their play-throughs a unique experience, such as... get through the entire game without ever picking up a powerup or coin defeat a boss without getting hit finish a stage without losing a life That is what makes this website so special, and what makes achievements something more than just beating a game. Even the most vocal critics who hate the idea of Achievements may say, \"Well, except for THIS one. This one was okay.\" And I guarantee you that ONE example they're talking about is a Challenge Achievement, something that challenged the player beyond the game itself. A good achievement developer will keep their eyes peeled, their wits about them, and their senses sharp when developing a game, looking for good, unusual challenges. They may notice something in the game that's a difficult feat.","title":"Challenges"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#speedrun-challenges","text":"Timers introduce an added pressure players may have never felt before while playing their favorite games. Few things get the heart pumping more than an imposing ticking clock. Add a timer element, and a game that was previously so easy they could beat it blindfolded could suddenly be transformed into the ultimate gaming challenge of their lives. Examples of Speedrun Challenges: Completing a game in under one hour. Clearing a specific stage in under three minutes. Undercut the timer by a certain number of seconds. Kill 30 vampire bats during the escape sequence. Collect 99 bonus coins before the bonus screen fades away. Go from point A to point B before day changes to night. Leaderboard - Complete the game with the fastest time possible. Leaderboard - Complete a given stage with the fastest time possible. A dev may want to head out to YouTube or Twitch and see how fast people are finishing a game (And please ignore TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Some pro speed-runners are so fast, the typical player here won't stand a chance at the times being posted, but you should be able to find a happy medium. And if you can't figure out a good time to challenge the players here, that's what Leaderboards are for - Turn it into a competition! In fact, some of your favorite celebrity speed-runners may come to this very site and submit a time or two. You'll know when you're facing a pressure achievement when your palms are sweating and you find yourself nervously glancing at the timer. Like I said before, nothing screams, \"Wake up!\" louder than a timer, especially when developers start weaving this kind of achievement with OTHER kinds of achievements (and even leaderboards) during a timed portion of a game. Timer Challenges have an insane amount of synergy with other types of achievements.","title":"Speedrun Challenges"},{"location":"Achievement-Design/#limitation-challenges","text":"Examples of Limitation Challenges: Clear a battle or even an entire game with all characters of a specific job class. (One famous example of this is clearing the original Final Fantasy with a group of White Mages.) Beat a final boss with no equipment on. Clear a stage without ever jumping. Solve a puzzle in only two moves. One-hit KOs. Low level games (LLGs). No hit achievements. Never hit certain button(s) during a challenge. Never lose invincibility through an entire Mario 3 stage by finding enough Starmen. Defeat a certain enemy without using a certain move. Reaching Ganon in Legend of Zelda, sword-less. Defeat a certain enemy ONLY using a certain move. Stumble your way through a maze while drunk/confused. Clear the game with a status ailment. Community websites built around certain games are a fantastic resource for these kinds of achievements They'll have a good idea about what's possible and impossible, and have likely written up FAQs discussing alternative and challenging ways to play the entire game. Often times, though, there will be no community. No FAQs. No Message Board. And maybe even no useful videos. In these cases, you'll need to be an idea person to come up with new and interesting ways to challenge the player.

Valores Delta link Um valor Delta \u00e9 o valor do frame anterior. Exemplos de como ele pode ser usado: Detectar se o n\u00edvel foi aumentado: level > delta level . Significa que \"o n\u00edvel atual \u00e9 maior que o n\u00edvel do frame anterior\". Detectar danos: health < delta health .

Se voc\u00ea definir manualmente uma contagem (hit), por exemplo 1, significa que a condi\u00e7\u00e3o deve ser verdadeira por pelo menos 1 frame e, uma vez que a contagem de hits seja atendida, ela n\u00e3o precisa ser atendida novamente em outro momento. ATEN\u00c7\u00c3O : se uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o tiver uma contagem de hits e atingir o n\u00famero necess\u00e1rio, esta condi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais testada. Ela \u00e9 verdadeira e permanece verdadeira, A MENOS que voc\u00ea tenha um Reset If , o qual discutiremos abaixo. Voc\u00ea pode ver como isso funciona no Exemplos Reais Special Flags link No Achievement Editor, \u00e9 o campo intitulado como Special? . Essas flags condicionais s\u00f3 funcionam se voc\u00ea definir uma contagem de hits para uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o. PauseIf link Isso pausar\u00e1 a atividade para todas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es no mesmo grupo. Nota : tenha em mente que isso n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 pausar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es em outros grupos. O PauseIf \u00e9 usado para pausar a contagem de hits em uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica (como pausar o jogo). \u00c9 usado quando voc\u00ea deseja manter a contagem de hits previamente conquistada, mas n\u00e3o deseja reinici\u00e1-la quando algu\u00e9m simplesmente faz uma pausa no jogo, por exemplo. ResetIf link Isso ir\u00e1 zerar a contagem de hits para todas condi\u00e7\u00f5es em que voc\u00ea definiu uma contagem de hits. Ele \u00e9 muito mais comum de usar do que PauseIf Nota : Ao contr\u00e1rio do PauseIf , le ir\u00e1 zerar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es em todos os grupos Voc\u00ea pode ver como isso funciona no Real Examples Add Source link Quando uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o tem a flag Add Source o valor daquele endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria \u00e9 adicionado ao valor do endere\u00e7o na condi\u00e7\u00e3o logo abaixo, e a compara\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 feita na condi\u00e7\u00e3o abaixo daquela com o Add Source . Isso pode soar um pouco confuso, mas o exemplo a seguir vai esclarecer como funciona: Neste exemplo o valor em 0x8010 ser\u00e1 adicionado ao valor em 0x8020 e a compara\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 se esta soma \u00e9 maior ou igual a zero. Se o valor em 0x8010 \u00e9 1 e o valor em 0x8020 \u00e9 2 , a compara\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 1 + 2 > 0 , ou 3 > 0 . Nota : todos os campos de compara\u00e7\u00e3o na condi\u00e7\u00e3o com a flag Add Source s\u00e3o ignorados. Tentando resumir esta explica\u00e7\u00e3o com uma imagem: Nota : voc\u00ea pode usar Add Source para somar mais endere\u00e7os, como no exempo abaixo: Sub Source link Funciona muito semelhante ao Add Source , por\u00e9m o Sub Source faz o valor naquele endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria ser negativo. Nota 1 : Sub Source N\u00c3O \u00e9 um flag de subtra\u00e7\u00e3o. Ele apenas torna o valor negativo. Nota 2 : A linha final (sem Add Source ou Sub Source ) ainda \u00e9 adicionada para a compara\u00e7\u00e3o final. Usando aquele exemplo de uso de Add Source example , se n\u00f3s o substitu\u00edssemos por Sub Source e com os mesmos valores ( valor(0x8010) = 1 e valor(0x8020) = 2 ), a compara\u00e7\u00e3o seria -1 + 2 > 0 , or 1 > 0 . Add Hits link Tamb\u00e9m funciona de maneira de similar ao Add Source , por\u00e9m relacionado aos hitcounts. O Add Hits adiciona o hitcount da condi\u00e7\u00e3o atual \u00e0 pr\u00f3xima condi\u00e7\u00e3o. O hitcount total a ser checado ser\u00e1 aquele definido na condi\u00e7\u00e3o logo ap\u00f3s a \u00faltima condi\u00e7\u00e3o com Add Hits . Se a condi\u00e7\u00e3o logo ap\u00f3s o \u00faltimo Add Hits n\u00e3o tiver um hitcount definido, todas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es com Add Hits ser\u00e3o ignoradas. Diferentemente do Add Source , todos os campos s\u00e3o usados numa condi\u00e7\u00e3o Add Hits , inclusive os campos de compara\u00e7\u00e3o. Se uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 verdadeira, o hitcount para esta condi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 incrementada (e parar\u00e1 de incrementar se assim que o n\u00famero de hitcount definido for atingido). As condi\u00e7\u00f5es com Add Hits n\u00e3o precisam ser verdadeiras para a conquista disparar. Por\u00e9m primeira condi\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s o \u00faltimo Add Hits , sim, precisa ser verdadeira. Groups link Os achievements podem ter grupos adicionados a eles que podem atuar como requisitos alternativos para desbloquear um achievement. Estes s\u00e3o chamados de Alt Groups . Uma coisa extremamente importante a notar: para uma conquista desbloquear, deve ter o Core group E pelo menos um Alt group ser verdadeiro . Se n\u00e3o houver nenhum grupo Alt presente, apenas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es do Core group's precisam ser verdadeiras. Dica : devido ao grupo Core sempre precisar ser verdadeiro, normalmente voc\u00ea colocaria l\u00e1 condi\u00e7\u00f5es que sejam \u00e0 todos os requisitos alternativos. No entanto, um truque que voc\u00ea pode usar para basicamente para ignorar a necessidade de um grupo Core \u00e9 dar-lhe uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 sempre verdadeira, como: Mem 0x0001 = Mem 0x0001 Como o grupo Core agora \u00e9 sempre verdadeiro, agora voc\u00ea pode se concentrar em diferenciar os grupos Alt.

They typically happens after someone present a plan in the game's forum topic and in the #revision-voting channel on Discord and the plan is approved by the achievement creators community. There are three types of revisions: Standard Revisions - Changes to an achievement set that affect another developer's work. These include adding achievements, removing achievements, and reworking existing achievements. Rescores - Changes to the point value of an achievement. Icon-Gauntlet - Changes to a game page's icon that is awarded upon mastering a set and changes to the individual achievement badges. Each are assigned their own Discord role: Type Role Getting the role Who can get the role Standard Revisions @revision-voting React with \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f here achievement creators Rescores @rescore React with \ud83d\udcaf here achievement creators Icon Gauntlet @icon-gauntlet React with \ud83c\udfa8 here any verified discord user Standard Revisions link Any developer wanting to revise a set need to: Prepare a plan for each (where you're not the original author) Addition Demotion Achievement rework If the original set developer(s) are still active, inform them of your plans. Not only would this be a \"courtesy call,\" they may have valuable insight or resources that you can utilize to help your revision. Present the plan in the game's forum topic. NOTE : Be as specific as possible, but if you have only a vague plan, provide a general idea of what you want to do and don't go too far from that idea. Post a link to that topic in #revision-voting . If you're not on Discord, another developer can do it for you. Once a revision vote is posted, the developer can address any comments, concerns, and objections the community may have to the plan. The vote is approved/rejected after 24 hours and is pass/fail by simple majority. Note: Anonymous revision proposals - If desired, a developer can choose to propose a revision plan while remaining anonymous throughout the voting process. Simply contact a mod or admin to request that the plan be presented on your behalf. When Making a Revision link Try to avoid making copies of existing achievements, or clone and demote existing copies. If there are issues with current achievements make fixes to the existing ones. Resolve any open tickets for achievements that will be kept in the set. If you are adding a similar concept to one found in the set, where possible reuse the old concept and update it rather than make a new one. This prevents players from having to unnecessarily re-earn achievements, restricts needless changes to sets, and preserves good quality developer work and concepts. Since revisions vary in the amount of adjusted content, they are treated the same as an achievement set reservation. If three months have passed since your revision plan was approved, you will need to provide an update that details the current progress. Not doing so will invalidate the revision and the plan will need to be approved again with a new vote. No Need for Approval link Making changes to an achievement or to an achievement set where you are the original author and no other developer has revised it; it is still a good idea to post the plan for your changes in the forum. Resolving tickets or bugs on achievements made by developers who are listed as inactive in the list of developers . In these cases you're only allowed to fix the achievement to match the description; do not change the intention of the achievement without going through the revision process above. If you find a problem with an achievement that has an active developer either create a ticket or contact them to assist in resolution. Adding battery save, cheat code, or password protections to achievements where the developer is inactive . (be sure to properly test your changes). If they are active , either create a ticket or contact them to assist applying the improvements. Fixing misspellings, grammatical errors, and other typos in the achievement names or descriptions. In some cases, these are intentional, so be sure to make note of it in the forum. Making updates to game page information and title / screenshot / box art images. Merging Sets link In the event that a revision includes merging two sets together (e.g. The Legend of Zelda for NES and the NES Classic version for GBA), the developer who does the revision needs to keep track of achievements in the demoted set and their equivalent achievements in the set it is being merged with. If the revision vote passes, this information must be sent to an admin so the achievements from the merged set can be manually awarded to the earners of the demoted set. Rescores link Up until June 2019, RetroAchievements sets had a cap of 400 points, with no restrictions on individual achievements. The set cap was removed to focus less on overall set totals and more on the achievements themselves. This initiative was also meant to eliminate the misconception that a set worth 400 points is a \"complete\" set, but is also an ongoing community effort to promote fairness across the board. Information on the scoring process can be found here . Anyone wanting to rescore a set needs to: Prepare a rescore plan that shows the original scores and the proposed scores. A quick and easy way to do this is by utilizing this sheet ; you can enter the Game ID in F2 to bring up a full list of that game's achievements and scores. Post the plan in the game's forum topic. Post a link to the topic in the #revision-voting channel on Discord. Prepare to do some negotiating with other users and try to find a good middle-ground. Voting will be active for 24 hours. If a rescore passes, you can make the necessary changes. No Need for Approval link Some achievement sets can be rescored without going through the voting process: If you are the only credited author of an achievement set being rescored and no other developer has rescored it. If a co-author you collaborated with on an achievement set gives you their blessing to do a rescore and no other developer has rescored it. If an achievement set was published before June 2019, has NOT been rescored yet, and has an inactive dev. Afterwards, these sets will need to go through the approval process. Icon Gauntlet link The Icon Gauntlet is used to vote for new game icons or new badges for a set. With the vote it is checked which version is preferred by the community. Any user wanting to change the game icon or badges of a set need to: Create the game icon or new badges. For more info, see Badge and Icon Creation . Upload the work on an image sharing site (e.g. https://imgur.com/ , http://lensdump.org , etc.) Post your images in the correct forum topic . Add the [game=GameID] tag and insert the Game ID which can be found in the URL of the game's page.

If you are adding a similar concept to one found in the set, where possible reuse the old concept and update it rather than make a new one. This prevents players from having to unnecessarily re-earn achievements, restricts needless changes to sets, and preserves good quality developer work and concepts. Since revisions vary in the amount of adjusted content, they are treated the same as an achievement set reservation. If three months have passed since your revision plan was approved, you will need to provide an update that details the current progress.

A si que NO tomes estas plantillas como una regla. Simplemente son para motivos educativos. En estos ejemplos utilizamos la siguiente definici\u00f3n, 0xNIVEL es el valor en memoria que representa el ID del Nivel; 0xVIDA es el valor utilizado para la vida de nuestro personaje; 0xTIEMPO para el tiempo, 0xITEM por obtener un item, etc... Coleccionando un Item N veces link Abra situaciones en las que quieras otorgar un logro por coleccionar un item (como una moneda o anillo) N numero de veces. Vas a necesitar encontrar el valor en memoria responsable en contar cuantas veces tienes un item. Una vez que tengas la variable, esta l\u00f3gica usualmente hace el trabajo: ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xCONTADOR > Delta 0xCONTADOR (N) Pero es mas probable que quieras ser mas especifico, por ejemplo \"obt\u00e9n el item N veces sin morir\". Entonces tendr\u00edas que utilizar otra condici\u00f3n con un ResetIf , de la siguiente manera: ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xCONTADOR > Delta 0xCONTADOR (N) 2 ResetIf 0xVIDAS < Delta 0xVIDAS La condici\u00f3n del ResetIf podr\u00eda ser \"mientras est\u00e9s en el nivel X\", \"sin utilizar una bomba\", etc. Termina el Nivel N link En este ejemplo queremos otorgar el logro cuando el jugador termino el nivel N y pasa al nivel N+1 .

Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xNIVEL = Value N (1) 2 0xNIVEL = Value N+1 3 0xNIVEL > Delta 0xNIVEL 4 ResetIf 0xNIVEL = Value TITULO Requisitos 1: En el nivel N m\u00ednimo una vez 2: Actualmente en el nivel N+1 3: El nivel a incrementado 4: Resetea el contador de hit cuando se vuelva a la pantalla de titulo El valor 0xTITULO significa \"en la pantalla de titulo del juego\". Tu necesitas poner un ResetIf en la pantalla de titulo para evitar que se dispare en el momento equivocado. Aqui hay un ejemplo de una situacion de un juego en el que podria hacer que el logro se dispare en el momento equivocado si no estuviera el ResetIf: Empieza el juego y llega al nivel 2 (esto hace que el contador valla a 1) Obtiene un game over mientras estaba en el nivel 2 Vuelve a la pantalla de titulo Utiliza una contrase\u00f1a para llegar al nivel 3 Si no utilizamos el ResetIf tendr\u00edamos estas condiciones: Hit nivel 2: VERDADERO Nivel actual = nivel 3: VERDADERO Nivel incrementado (de pantalla de titulo/passwords a nivel 3): VERDADERO Y seria lo suficiente para que el logro se dispare (en un momento equivocado). Por eso estamos utilizando el ResetIf en este ejemplo. Termina el Nivel N antes de que el tiempo llegue a T link En este ejemplo vamos a considerar un juego en el que el tiempo decrementa (ej.: Super Mario Bros). Adapta el logro de acuerdo al comportamiento del tiempo de tu juego. Queremos premiar el logro si el jugador termina el nivel N mientras el tiempo es mayor que T . ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xNIVEL = Value N (1) 2 0xNIVEL = Value N+1 3 0xNIVEL > Delta 0xNIVEL 4 ResetIf 0xNIVEL = Value TITULO 5 0xTIEMPO >= Value T Requisitos Los Requisitos 1-4 son los mismos que la plantilla Termina el Nivel N . 5: el contador es mas grande que T . Ten en cuenta que mas all\u00e1 de saber como funciona el contador en tu juego tambi\u00e9n necesitas saber como se maneja en la memoria del juego. Termina el Nivel N sin Morir (o sin que te peguen, usar un arma, etc.) link ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xNIVEL = Value N (1) 2 0xNIVEL = Value N+1 3 0xNIVEL > Delta 0xNIVEL 4 ResetIf 0xNIVEL = Value TITULO 5 0xPANTALLA = Value NVL_N_INTRO (1) 6 ResetIf 0xVIDA < Delta 0xVIDA Requisitos Los Requisitos 1-4 son los mismos que los de la plantilla Termina el Nivel N . 5: un checkpoint para representar el punto donde el jugador se supone que empieza el reto sin perder una vida. Si el nivel tiene una pantalla de intro por nivel, este puede ser un buen checkpoint. 6: se resetea el hit count si la vida se decrementa. El requisito 6 tambi\u00e9n puede ser utilizado para resetear el si se utiliza un arma, se recibe da\u00f1o, o cualquier otra cosa que NO quieras que el jugador haga. Termina el Nivel N con un Item link ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xNIVEL = Value N (1) 2 0xNIVEL = Value N+1 3 0xNIVEL > Delta 0xNIVEL 4 ResetIf 0xNIVEL = Value TITULO 5 0xITEM = Value VERDADERO Requisitos Los Requisitos 1-4 son los mismos que los de la plantilla Termina el Nivel N . 5: el jugador tiene un item Colecciona un item en un nivel en especifico link Esta plantilla es para salvados de bater\u00eda o protecci\u00f3n contra passwords para items. Evita premiar \"obten x item\" cargando cuando el jugador ya cuenta con ese item. Checa que el item se obtenga en nivel/habitacion donde se supone que tenga que ser obtenido, y solo lo premia cuando se hace de esa manera. ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xITEM = Value FALSO (1) 2 0xITEM = Value VERDADERO 3 ResetIf 0xNIVEL != Value nivel donde se colecciona Requisitos 1: No tener el item cuando se entra al nivel en el que se obtiene, el hit es un checkpoint asi que 1&2 pueden ser verdaderos al mismo tiempo. 2: Tener el item 3: Resetea el hit counter si se esta en un nivel diferente del cual se obtiene el item Los Requisitos 1 y 3 juntos significan \"llego al ID de nivel/habitacion sin el item\". Incluso si el jugador carga un estado de guardado y va al nivel requerido el no seria capaz de a\u00f1adir hits a la condici\u00f3n 1, ya que no se pueden conseguir solamente por gameplay normal. No necesita ser necesariamente un ID de nivel/habitaci\u00f3n. Hay otros m\u00e9todo para enfrentar este problema, por ejemplo ejemplo un valor en memoria \u00fanico que solo ocurre cuando lo coleccionas. Etc. Colecciona 100% en algo link Esta es proteccion limitada de salvado de bateria /proteccion de password cuando el jugador coleccione 100% de algo como pasar cada stage en Super Mario world, u obtener 100% en el porcentaje de coleccionables en Super Metroid. Es necesario que el jugador no pueda simplemente cargar un save con 100% y obtener el logro de a gratis. (Como siempre hay otras maneras de enfrentar este problema tambi\u00e9n.) ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 Delta 0xPorcentajeColeccionado < Value valor 100% 2 Mem 0xPorcentajeColeccionado = Value valor 100% 3 PauseIf Mem 0xEstadoJugador != Value Modo especifico/punto donde % es incrementado Usar la variable y el valor indicado en la condici\u00f3n 3 es especialmente importante. Necesitas encontrar una variable que represente un momento \u00fanico en el juego cuando este porcentaje aumenta. Tu no quieres que el logro salte cuando el jugador cargue su archivo de guardado, que quiere decir que el logro tiene que ser pausado en ese momento. Ejemplo : En Super Mario World este cambio pasa cuando el jugador observa el mapa del mundo despu\u00e9s de a ver completado un stage. Nota: Este comportamiento es similar y el resultado a Colecciona un item en un nivel en especifico . Evitando el Problema de que un Contador se Incremente Dos Veces en el Mismo Frame link En Coleccionando un item N veces estamos contando que tantas veces este contador aumenta. Pero en algunos juegos hay algunas situaciones en el que el contador aumenta al doble en el mismo frame, y el hit counter se incremente solo por uno. Este comportamiento, obviamente, arruina nuestra l\u00f3gica. Vamos a ver una manera para evitar este problema. La t\u00e9cnica utilizada aqu\u00ed se baza en otras dos: Utilizando SubSource para Contar Incrementos Especificos Bandera AddHits Aqu\u00ed esta el truco: ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 SubSource Delta 0xCONTADOR 2 AddHits Mem 0xCONTADOR = Value 0x02 3 Mem 0xCONTADOR > Delta 0xCONTADOR (N) 4 ResetIf Mem 0xVIDAS < Delta 0xVIDAS Podr\u00eda verse un poco confuso a primera vista, pero talvez utilizando un ejemplo de verdad pueda ser todo mas claro. Checa Evitar el Problema de que un Contador se Incremente Dos Veces en el Mismo Frame . Checar el cambio de un valor especifico a otro valor especifico diez veces link En este ejemplo queremos detectar que un valor cambie de V1 a V2 diez veces: ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 Delta 0xADDRESS = Value 0xV1 (10) 2 Mem 0xADDRESS = Value 0xV2 (10) 3 PauseIf Mem 0xADDRESS = Delta 0xADDRESS Requisitos 1: Si el valor en 0xADDRESS en el frame anterior es 0xV1 , aumenta el hitcount (hasta 10). 2: Si el valor en 0xADDRESS es igual a 0xV1 , aumenta el hitcount (hasta 10). 3: No aumente los hitcounts en 1 y 2 si cambian en 0xADDRESS . Resets Condicionales link Resets Condicionales se pueden utilizar para muchas cosas. Digamos que quieres tener un reset si el jugador entra a cierta zona X e Y del nivel: CORE En el Core ira cualquier condiciones que necesites para que el logro sea verdadero. Tambien puede contener un Reset con comportamiento normal. ALT1 ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val 1 ResetIf Mem 0xNIVEL = Value NIVELID 2 PauseIf Mem 0xX-COORDS > Value RESET-X-ZONE 3 PauseIf Mem 0xX-COORDS < Value RESET-X-ZONE 4 PauseIf Mem 0xY-COORDS > Value RESET-Y-ZONE 5 PauseIf Mem 0xY-COORDS < Value RESET-Y-ZONE El reset solo va a pasar si todas las condiciones Pauseif no son verdaderas. El pause es local en el alt pero el reset resetea todo el logro. ALT2 ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val 1 Mem 0x1 = Mem 0x1 Cualquier condici\u00f3n que sea verdadera. (para satisfacer el comportamiento de un alt teniendo una condici\u00f3n que siempre es verdadera es necesaria) Nota: Puedes utilizar m\u00faltiples resets condicionales, cada uno en su propio alt group para tener un control mas grande del comportamiento de los reseteos.

You can use them as inspiration to create your own achievement. But keep in mind the following: EVERY GAME IS DIFFERENT! The memory has a different behavior from game to game. So do NOT take these templates as a rule. They are here just for educational purposes. In these examples we use the following convention 0xLEVEL is the memory address with the level ID; 0xLIFE is the address used for the character life; 0xTIME for time, 0xITEM for getting an item, etc... Collecting an Item N times link There are some situations where you want to award an achievement for collecting an item (like a coin or a ring) N times.

Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xCOUNT > Delta 0xCOUNT (N) But you most likely will want to be more specific, for example \"get item N times without dying\".

You need to ResetIf going to the title screen to avoid the awarding at a wrong time. Here is an example of game flow that could make the achievement trigger at a wrong time if it wasn't for that ResetIf: Start the game and reach level 2 (this make the hit counter goes to 1) Get a game over while on level 2 Go back to the title screen Use a password for level 3 If not using the ResetIf we will have these conditions: Hit level 2: TRUE Current level = level 3: TRUE Level increased (from title/password screen to level 3): TRUE And it would be enough to trigger the cheevo (at a wrong time). That's why we're using the ResetIf in this example. Finish Level N before Time reaches T link In this example we consider a game where the time decreases (e.g.: Super Mario Bros). Adapt it accordingly the time on your game has a different behavior. We want to award if the player finishes the level N while time is greater than T . ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xLEVEL = Value N (1) 2 0xLEVEL = Value N+1 3 0xLEVEL > Delta 0xLEVEL 4 ResetIf 0xLEVEL = Value TITLE 5 0xTIME >= Value T Requirements Requirements 1-4 are the same as Finish Level N template. 5: timer is greater than T . Keep in mind that besides knowing how the time behaves in game you also need to research how it behaves in memory. Finish Level N without Dying (or getting hit, using a weapon, etc.) link ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xLEVEL = Value N (1) 2 0xLEVEL = Value N+1 3 0xLEVEL > Delta 0xLEVEL 4 ResetIf 0xLEVEL = Value TITLE 5 0xSCREEN = Value LVL_N_INTRO (1) 6 ResetIf 0xLIFE < Delta 0xLIFE Requirements Requirements 1-4 are the same as Finish Level N template. 5: a checkpoint to represent the point from where the player is suposed to start the chalenge of not losing a life. If the game has a level intro screen, it can be a good checkpoint. 6: reset hit count if life decreased. The requirement 6 can also be used to reset hit count if a weapon was used, damage taken, or anything else that you want the player to NOT do. Finish Level N with Item link ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xLEVEL = Value N (1) 2 0xLEVEL = Value N+1 3 0xLEVEL > Delta 0xLEVEL 4 ResetIf 0xLEVEL = Value TITLE 5 0xITEM = Value TRUE Requirements Requirements 1-4 are the same as Finish Level N template. 5: the player have the item Collect an Item in a specific Level link This template is for battery save or password protection for items. It avoids awarding \"get item X\" by loading to where player already has the item. It checks that an item is collected in the level/room ID it is supposed to be collected, and only allows it be earned at that time. ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xITEM = Value FALSE (1) 2 0xITEM = Value TRUE 3 ResetIf 0xLEVEL != Value collect level Requirements 1: Do not have the item when entered the collect level, the hit is a checkpoint so 1&2 can both be true at once. 2: Have the item 3: Reset hit counter if in a level different than the one where the item must be obtained Requirements 1 and 3 together mean \"arrived the level/Room ID without the item\". Even if the player loads a savestate and goes to the required level they will not be able to add hits to condition 1, thus they can't get it except in normal gameplay. It does not necessarily have to be level/Room ID. There are other ways to approach this problem, for example a unique Mem/Val that only occurs on collection. Etc. Collected 100% of Something link This is limited battery save /password protection for when a player will collect 100% of something like clearing each stage in Super Mario world, or getting a 100% collection rate in Super Metroid. It's necessary so that a player cannot just load a save at 100% and get the achievement for free. (As usual there are other ways to approach this problem too.) ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 Delta 0xCollectPercent < Value 100% value 2 Mem 0xCollectPercent = Value 100% value 3 PauseIf Mem 0xPlayerState != Value Specific mode/point in game where % is increased Using the correct address value for condition 3 is especially important. You need to find an address that represents a unique time in the game where this percent increases. You'd not want the achievement to trigger when the player is loading their in game save file, which means this achievement must be paused at that time. Example : In Super Mario World this change happens while the player sees the world map after completing a stage. Note: This is similar in behavior and result to Collect an Item in a specific Level . Circumvent the Problem of a Counter Incrementing Twice in the Same Frame link In the Collecting an Item N times we are counting how many times the counter goes up. But in some games there are situations where the counter goes up twice in the same frame, and the hit counter is incremented only by one. This behavior, obviously, ruins our logic. We're going to see a way to circumvent this issue. The technique used here relies on two other ones: using SubSource to count specific increments AddHits Flag Here's the trick: ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 SubSource Delta 0xCOUNT 2 AddHits Mem 0xCOUNT = Value 0x02 3 Mem 0xCOUNT > Delta 0xCOUNT (N) 4 ResetIf Mem 0xLIVES < Delta 0xLIVES It can looks a bit confusing at a first sight, but maybe using a real example it can be more clear. Check the Circumvent the Problem of a Counter Incrementing Twice in the Same Frame . Check for a specific value changing to another specific value ten times link In this example we want to detect a value changing from V1 to V2 ten times: ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 AndNext Delta 0xADDRESS = Value 0xV1 2 Mem 0xADDRESS = Value 0xV2 (10) Requirements 1: If value in 0xADDRESS in the previous frame is 0xV1 2: AND If the current value in 0xADDRESS is 0xV2 , increases the hitcount (up to 10). Conditional Resets link Conditional resets can be used for many things. Lets say you want to have a reset if a player enters a certain X and Y zone of a level: CORE The Core is whatever condition(s) you need for your achievement to be true. It can also include normal reset behavior. ALT1 ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val 1 ResetIf Mem 0xLEVEL = Value LEVELID 2 PauseIf Mem 0xX-COORDS > Value RESET-X-ZONE 3 PauseIf Mem 0xX-COORDS < Value RESET-X-ZONE 4 PauseIf Mem 0xY-COORDS > Value RESET-Y-ZONE 5 PauseIf Mem 0xY-COORDS < Value RESET-Y-ZONE The reset will only happen if all of the Pauseif conditions are not true. The pause is local to the alt but the reset resets the entire achievement. ALT2 ID Special? Type Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val 1 Mem 0x1 = Mem 0x1 Any true condition. (to satisfy alt behavior having an always true alt is needed) Note: You can use multiple conditional resets, each one in their own alt group to have far greater control of reset behavior.

It works similar to AddSource , but modifies the address, not the resulting value. Additionally, it affects addresses on both sides of the condition. AddAddress only affects the next condition. If multiple AddAddress lines are chained together, each lookup in the chain will be altered; the values won't all be added to the final lookup. The 32-bit value at 0x0112F8 is a pointer to the data for the first character in the party. When the party order changes, the pointer will point at a different block of memory, but data within the block will have the same structure. The value is an address in the actual system representation and differs from the addresses provided by the memory inspector. However, you can rely on the fact that the memory inspector represents the same memory, so while the actual address may differ, the sequence of bytes does not. To translate the real pointer to a memory inspector address, we compare the two values. For example: The 32-bit value at 0x0112F8 is 0x800110B8. The memory we're interested in is at 0x011114 in the memory inspector. Using a 24-bit read instead of a 32-bit read gives us 0x0110B8 0x011114 - 0x0110B8 = 0x00005C, so that becomes the \"base address\" in the second condition. Types of Pointers link AddAddress is how RAIntegration handles pointers. There are four major types of pointer support: Direct Pointer : The pointer contains another address that is referenced without modification. These are most commonly used for string pointers. To use a direct pointer, the base address to which the pointer is added would be 0. Indirect Pointer : The pointer contains another address that indicates the start of some block of data. The data of interest is a fixed number of bytes into the block of data. These are commonly used for attributes of a character/object. For both Direct and Indirect Pointers, the AddAddress line should reference the pointer, and the address in the following line should be the offset into the block of data for the information relevant to the condition. While you would typically use 0 for a Direct Pointers, the following line would also contain any value necessary to convert between a real address and a memory inspector address. The example above is an Indirect Pointer, where the data is 0x5C bytes into a block of data. The conversion from a real address to a memory inspector address is handled by using a 24-bit read instead of a 32-bit read. Array Index : The pointer contains an offset to apply to a fixed pointer. Scaled Array Index : The pointer contains an offset to apply to a fixed pointer after it has been scaled. For Array Indices, the AddAddress line should reference the offset to apply, and the following line should contain the address of the first element of the array (index 0). For example: AddAddress 16-bit Mem 0x1234 8-bit Mem 0x4567 Would read a 16-bit number from 0x1234 and read the single byte that is that many bytes after 0x4567. NOTE: Scaling an array index is not currently supported . The intent is that the first line would become AddAddress 16-bit Mem 0x1234 * 4 to indicate that each time 0x1234 is incremented by 1, the offset past 0x4567 would be incremented by 4. Attempting to call AddAddress four times to simulate the multiplication won't work because each line of the chain is a separate lookup. Chaining Pointers link AddAddress can be chained to perform multi-step lookups, but only one step at a time. As such, you can reference data pointed at by a pointer that's pointed at by another pointer, but you can't reference data in an array that's pointed at by another pointer unless either the array or the array index is at a fixed address.

The AddHits / SubHits conditions do not have to be true for the achievement to trigger. They modify the hit count of another condition, which does have to be true for the achievement to trigger. The sequence of conditions is referred to as a AddHits chain (even if it contains SubHits ). When a condition with the AddHits / SubHits flag is true, the hit count for that condition is incremented. A hit target may be placed on the condition to keep it from tallying too many times. The total hit count of the final condition in a chain is incremented by the hit counts of any AddHits conditions in the chain, and decremented by any SubHits conditions in the chain. If the total hit count meets or exceeds the target hit count of the final condition, it's considered true. If the final condition of the chain does not have a hit target, the AddHits / SubHits conditions have no effect on the achievement. The final condition will be true if, and only if, it is true by itself. NOTE : The hit target on the final condition of the chain serves as both the overall target hit count and the maximum hit count for that condition. As a result, it is impossible to use SubHits without AddHits , as any hits subtracted by the SubHits could not be recovered without a separate AddHits . Similarly, if you need to put a condition-specific limit on the final condition of the chain, you should pull it out as an AddHits condition with the appropriate limit and use a dummy final condition with the overall hit target (i.e. 0=1 (10) ). The dummy condition would never accumulate any hits of its own, and only serve to tally the other values in the chain.

When using ResetIf and PauseIf , PauseIf only pauses the group that it's in, but ResetIf resets hit counts in all groups and prevents achievements from triggering so long as the reset is active. Using Alt Groups for Conditional Resets link Advanced: An Alt group can be used to create a ResetIf condition that is only active some of the time. If you create an Alt group containing a PauseIf condition and a ResetIf condition, you can use the PauseIf condition to disable the ResetIf condition under certain circumstances without disabling the entire achievement. The Reset will still affect all groups, including your core group. The Pause will only pause the Alt group containing the PauseIf. This logic can be applied to multiple Alt groups in the same achievement to protect several separate Reset statements. Make sure that you have at least one Alt group that will be true or the achievement won't trigger. The easiest way to do this is to create an extra alt group that has one condition that is Value 1 = Value 1 . Beware : If your Pause condition is false, and the Reset condition is also false, the group will be considered true unless you have another always false condition in the group. When using an Alt group to segregate a PauseIf, make sure to include an always false condition like Value 1 = Value 0 .

Que pasa con la imagen cuando subes el icono de un juego link Cuando se sube, tu imagen es reducida a un PNG de 32-bits colores y a un tama\u00f1o de 96x96. Si subes un icono que sea mas peque\u00f1o que 96x96 la imagen va a retener su tama\u00f1o original. Lo mismo pasa para los Badges, excepto que el tama\u00f1o maximo para los badges es de 64x64. (El de Imagenes de Perfil es de 128x128.) Servidores de los Archivos de Iconos link Los Iconos son almacenados en el sitio de la siguiente manera y lugar: i.retroachievements.org/Images/000705.png .

Sonic the Hedgehog's primer Badge - #00199) ## Gu\u00edas y Tips en la Creaci\u00f3n de Badges link Los Badges tienen que estar relacionados con lo que se trate el logro - por ejemplo: la foto de un jefe, nivel o coleccionable que requiere que el jugador consiga. Checa dise\u00f1os de varios de tus juegos favoritos. Algunos usuarios ponen un gran esfuerzo en crear badges realmente atractivos: Aqu\u00ed esta un tema del foro lleno de grandes tips. En el caso de logros de juegos de muy baja-resoluci\u00f3n, puede ser dificil conseguir que un badge que se mire bien y que este no se mira tosco o borroso , en estos casos un look mas tosco es mucho mas preferible, ya que las im\u00e1genes tiene esa sensaci\u00f3n retro en ellas. Puedes hacer que cada Badge tengan un peque\u00f1os bordes pandeados como un Badge/Emblema actual o algunos bordes extras punteados para mas \u00e9nfasis o una corona de rey para los mas dif\u00edciles. Es tu dise\u00f1o. Deber\u00eda de presentar el logro de una manera visual, o que sea una pista para evadir secretos del juego. Estar a la par con el estilo de arte del juego tambi\u00e9n funciona bien. Buscar en Google Image \"Sprite Sheets\" es tambi\u00e9n otro \u00fatil tip para incluir alg\u00fan arte del juego. Tama\u00f1o y Archivo del Badge - mejores practicas link Los badges que se suban tienen que ser cuadrados (tener las misma dimensi\u00f3n X y Y), de otra manera la imagen resultar\u00eda distorsionada y fea. Subir im\u00e1genes PNG en formato no-entrelazado; evita utilizar una capa de transparencia ya que va a salir un fondo blanco en el. Dise\u00f1a im\u00e1genes en 64x64, 48x48 o 32x32 por la mejor calidad. Los logros se tienen que hacer de una manera que la tem\u00e1tica se sea clara incluso en 32x32, ya que son reducidas a este tama\u00f1o com\u00fanmente en el sitio, como en el feed global de notificaciones. Subiendo Badges (Desarrollador) link Si te encuentras creando logros eres libre de subir badges para ellos. Los Badges se suben con las herramientas de desarrollador del emulador por medio del editor de logros: O tambi\u00e9n puedes seleccionar una imagen prefabricada o encontrar otras im\u00e1genes que haz subido por medio de la lista desglosable: Subir archivos .jpg , .jpg o .gif . No es completamente importante el formato, pero si es completamente recomendable que la imagen sea cuadrada. Si el juego ya cuenta con badges existentes \u00e9chale una checada y sigue el procedimiento para Subiendo Badges (No-Desarrollador) . Subiendo Badges (No-Desarrollador) link Postea todas las im\u00e1genes nuevas que quieres remplazar en el foro oficial del juego. Tambi\u00e9n enlista cuales badges quieres remplazar. Un desarrollador o un moderador va a evaluar tu trabajo y decidir si, s\u00ed ser\u00e1n remplazados. Si as\u00ed lo deciden se posteara un respaldo de los iconos actuales en el foro, y tambi\u00e9n se remplazaran por los nuevos. Este respaldo es necesario si llega a existir el caso en el que hay desacuerdos con los nuevos badges. En estos casos algunos o todos los badges podr\u00edan ser revertidos a los anteriores. Es mas f\u00e1cil hacer una referencia a los viejos y nuevos badges como links de img : - ejemplo: [img=https://retroachievements.org/Badge/01234.png] -> [img=https://retroachievements.org/badge/56789.png] - (Dev) percatate de capturar los antiguos ID de los badges del Editor de Logros antes de subir los nuevos - El ID de los nuevos badges aparecer\u00e1n en el Editor de Logros despu\u00e9s de que sean subidos. - ambos valores tambi\u00e9n pueden ser capturados desde el sitio web, pero tienes que copiar el link de la imagen como el hover link del logro. Aqu\u00ed hay un ejemplo perfecto de como hacer un respaldo apropiado de Badges reci\u00e9n cambiados . Que pasa con la imagen cuando subes un Badge link Cuando se sube, tu archivo es convertido a lo siguiente: - 64x64 PNG de 32-bit de color. Ejemplo: ![00136](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8508804/37221161-b9b0bb02-23a7-11e8-81b2-3d09fa7456af.png) 64x64 PNG borroso y con escala de grises. Ejemplo: Servidor de los Archivos de Badges link Estos se almacenan en el sitio de la siguiente manera y lugar: i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00136.png ; el numero coincide con el ID de Badges que se encuentra con el Editor de Logros. Donde se muestran los Badges e Iconos link En tablas de Clasificacion: 96x96 (Solamente Iconos) En emuladores de RA: 64x64 Paginas de Juego: 64x64 Paginas de Usuarios: 48x48 Actualmente jugando/Rich Presence y en el Feed Global: 32x32 La im\u00e1genes actuales no se les cambia el tama\u00f1o. La imagen es escalada por el navegador al tama\u00f1o correspondiente. Algunos navegadores como el de Android muestran de una manera mas clara las im\u00e1genes mas grandes. Tambi\u00e9n puedes aumentar el zoom de tu navegador para ver aun mas claro. Se espera que en la versi\u00f3n futura del sitio, los Iconos y Badges se muestren en tama\u00f1o completo en otros lugares.

Due to their prominence on game and user pages they are worth special attention. Sonic the Hedgehog's game Icon Designing New Game Icons - Styling Guide link When designing a new game icon consider the following: Much of the community prefers that game icons use art assets that were made for the original game; from inside the game, or for the game documents, or for the game manual, or for promotional material, and so on; art created by the original team. Using more current designs (or fan art) for classic video game characters might be seem appealing. But many find this is disrespectful to the source material . Flexibility for the Styling Guide link For unlicensed games or ~hacks~ where there is little original art available non-official art might be reasonable. Making modifications to the art assets available for would usually be reasonable. Using outside or hand-made assets, say for a title or border, would be reasonable so long as the main subject uses official art. Do I Have to Follow This Styling Guide? link The style you choose for your designs is still up to you. You can break these rules so long as you do not break any copyright law, or upload anything vulgar, offensive or pornographic. Other Icon Design Tips link Browse the games list , to find Icons that speak to you. Mimic and innovate on the style of your favorites. Many of the Badge creation tips apply here as well. Icon File and Size - Best Practices link Uploaded Icons should be square (have the same X and Y dimensions), otherwise the resulting image will be distorted and ugly. Upload using non-interlaced PNG format; avoid using a transparency layer as it will come out in the end with a flat white box. Design images at 96x96 (preferred), 64x64, 48x48 or 32x32 for sharpest clarity. Icons and badges should be made in a way that the subject is clear even when sized at 32x32 as they are often reduced to this size, like on the global feed. Uploading Game Icons (Developer) link Achievement Developers are allowed to change game icons freely for entries that do not have achievements. As a Developer if you'd like to post a backup of the previous image there, if there is one, or backup yours in the forum you're free to but not required. As you create a new set of achievements you are free to create or choose the image you'd like to use as the game icon. To change a game icon first go to the game page and click on the Dev tools: Then click the choose file button highlighted. Find the file on your PC, and then press the submit button highlighted: If a game has existing achievements, game icon changes need to go through revision process . Uploading game icons (non-Developer) link Yes, you absolutely can, but they are subject to revisions . It will also be good to review the guidelines for designing new game icons . What happens to the image when you upload a game Icon link When uploaded, your Icon images are reduced to a maximum 96x96 32-bit colour PNG. If you upload an Icon that is smaller than 96x96 the image uploaded will retain its original size. The same is true for Badges, except Badges maximum size is 64x64. (Profile images maximum is 128x128.) Icon server files link Icons are stored on the site in the following manner and place: i.retroachievements.org/Images/000705.png . They are stored in the same server folder as other game images such as the game box and game screenshots. Achievement Badges link Badges are the user created images for individual achievements of a game. Sonic the Hedgehog's first Badge - #00199) Badge creation guidelines and tips link Badges should refer in some way to what the achievement is about - i.e. a picture of the boss, level or collectible that the achievement requires the player to get to. Check out the designs of some of your favorite games. Some users go to great effort to make visually appealing badges: Here's a forum topic full of great tips. In the cases of low-resolution games' achievements, it can be hard to get a Badge looking good without it looking blocky or blurry , in these cases the blocky look is often preferable, so that the images have a retro feel to them. You can make each Badge have little rounded borders like an actual Badge or some extra spiky corners for emphasis or a king's crown for difficult ones. Its your design. It should visually represent the achievement itself, or hint at the location in the game for secrets. Matching to the game's art style works well. Google Image searches for \"Sprite Sheets\" is another useful tip to include some game art. Badge file and size - best practices link Uploaded Badges should be square (have the same X and Y dimensions), otherwise the resulting image will be distorted and ugly. Upload using non-interlaced PNG format; avoid using a transparency layer as it will come out in the end with a flat white box. Design images at 64x64, 48x48 or 32x32 for sharpest clarity. Badges should be made in a way that the subject is clear even when sized at 32x32, as they are often reduced to this size, like on the global feed. Uploading a Badge for new achievements (Developer) link If you are creating new achievements you are free to upload badges for them. Badges are uploaded from within the emulator developer tools while in the achievement editor: Or you can select a prefabricated image or find other images you've uploaded in the drop down box: Upload .jpg , .jpg or .gif file types. It's not entirely important how the file is formatted before uploading, but it is strongly recommended that it be square. If the game has existing badges review and follow the procedure for Uploading Badges (Non-Developer) . Making new Badges for existing achievements link If you'd like to make improved badges for existing achievements, you can. Your images will go through the revision process , which will put your creations to a community vote. Post all the new images you'd like to replace current ones in the Icon Gauntlet Forum Topic . Also post all the badges that the new images are meant to replace. They will be placed for a community review by as a single vote. After a community vote is complete if you are a dev you can replace the Badges or if you are not, ask for help in the #help-me channel on Discord or in the Icon Gauntlet Forum Topic . It's easiest to just reference the old and new Badges as img links: Example: [img=https://retroachievements.org/Badge/01234.png] -> [img=https://retroachievements.org/badge/56789.png] (Dev) Make sure to capture the old Badge ID from the Achievement Editor before uploading the new Badge The new Badge ID will appear in the Achievement Editor after uploading it. Both values can also be captured from the web site, but you have to copy the image links as the hover link is for the achievement.

En la libreria del Game Boy Advance hay un plataformero Navide\u00f1o conocido como Santa Claus Jr. Advance . Hay algunos logros de coleccionar varios dulces en cada uno de los Stages Bonus. Esos logros se suponen que tendrian que ser algo simple, como esto: ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xDULCES != Delta 0xDULCES (N) 2 ResetIf 0xSTAGE != Value 0xBONUS Esto se traducir\u00eda \"checa si el contador de dulces cambio N veces en el stage bonus\". Nota : estamos utilizando 0xDULCES != Delta 0xDULCES (utilizando != , y no > ) porque cuando el jugador cuenta con 99 dulces y colecciona uno mas el contador se va a cero. Sin embargo, hay un aspecto en este juego (y muchos otros) donde si el jugador colecciona 2 dulces a la vez el contador va a aumentar por 2 en el mismo frame. Cuando pasa el contador de hits es aumentado por uno mientras que el contador de dulces aumento en dos. Esto, obviamente, arruina la l\u00f3gica que utilizamos arriba. En manera que podamos evitar este problema tenemos que utilizar la t\u00e9cnica de utilizar SubSource para contar incrementos espec\u00edficos combinado con una AddHits flag . Echemos un vistazo a la l\u00f3gica del logro y as\u00ed poder ver la explicaci\u00f3n: Variables (Addresses) 0x80dc : Contador de Dulces. 0x809c : ID de Stage. As\u00ed que ahora la estructura de logro seria de esta manera: Condiciones Junto con la condici\u00f3n 2, es un truco para ver si 0xDULCES - Delta 0xDULCES = 2 . En otras palabras, el contador de dulces fue incrementado por dos. Utilizando a la vez con la condici\u00f3n 1 (como se explica arriba) y 3. Como se explica en su respectiva pagina , cuando la condici\u00f3n de AddHits es verdadera, el hit counter en la siguiente condici\u00f3n es incrementado. Entonces , en nuestro ejemplo de aqu\u00ed, cuando condici\u00f3n 2 es verdadera, el hitcounter en condici\u00f3n 3 es incrementado. Contador cuando el contador de dulces cambia. Resetear contador si no se encuentra en un Stage Bonus. Todas esta condiciones se pueden traducir como \"mientras est\u00e9s en un stage bonus, salta el logro si el contador de dulces cambia 99 veces, y si el contador de dulces es incrementado por 2 en el mismo frame, a\u00f1ade un cambio extra al contador de dulces.\" Changelog link Last 10 changes on this page: [2019-04-16 15:33] meleu: fix broken links [2019-04-16 11:15] eldexterr: ES title changed to es","title":"Evitar el Problema de que un Contador se Incremente Dos Veces en el Mismo Frame"},{"location":"Circumvent-the-Problem-of-a-Counter-Incrementing-Twice-in-the-Same-Frame-es/#changelog","text":"Last 10 changes on this page: [2019-04-16 15:33] meleu: fix broken links [2019-04-16 11:15] eldexterr: ES title changed to es","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"Circumvent-the-Problem-of-a-Counter-Incrementing-Twice-in-the-Same-Frame/","text":"In this example you'll see how to circumvent the problem of a counter incrementing twice in the same frame by combining SubSource and AddHits . In the Game Boy Advance library there's a Christmas platformer game called Santa Claus Jr. Advance . There are some achievements for collecting all candy canes in each one of the bonus stages. Such achievements were supposed to be quite simple, like this: ID Special? Memory Cmp Type Mem/Val Hits 1 0xCANDIES != Delta 0xCANDIES (N) 2 ResetIf 0xSTAGE != Value 0xBONUS This translates into \"check if the candy canes counter changed N times in the bonus stage\". Note : we're using 0xCANDIES != Delta 0xCANDIES (using != , and not > ) cause when the player has 99 candies and collect one more, the counter goes to zero. However, there is an aspect in this game (and many others) where if the player collect 2 candy canes simultaneously the counter is increased by 2 in the same frame. When it happens the hit counter is increased by one while the candy counter is increased by two. This, obviously, ruins the logic used above. In order to circumvent this issue we have to use that technique of using SubSource to count specific increments combined with the AddHits flag . Let's take a look at the achievement logic and then we'll see the explanation: Addresses 0x80dc : Candy Canes counter. 0x809c : Stage ID. So now the structure of the achievement is going to be like this: Conditions Together with condition 2, is a trick used to check if 0xCANDIES - Delta 0xCANDIES = 2 . In other words, the candy counter was incremented by two. Used together with condition 1 (as explained above) and 3. As explained in its respective page , when the AddHits condition is true, the hit counter in the next condition is incremented. Therefore, in our example here, when condition 2 is true, the hitcounter in condition 3 is incremented. Count when the candy counter changes. Reset the counter if not in the Bonus stage. All these conditions could be translated as \"while in the bonus stage, trigger the achievement if the candy counter changes 99 times, and if the candy counter is incremented by 2 in the same frame, count an extra change in the candy counter.\" So, now it is 100% solved, right? Well, actually, almost. There is still a very minor exception. Remember it was said before that != was being used instead of > because when the player has 99 candies and collect one more, the counter goes to zero ? This means that, if we get two canes in the same frame (which is already rare), there's a very small possibility that this change will be from 98 -> 00 or from 99 -> 01 . In these only two cases our code won't work, because 00 - 98 is not 2, it is -98 . Same thing for 01 - 99 , it is not 2, it is also -98 . Despite being a very unlikely possibility, we should treat this case too. So we're gonna add two more requirements to the code, and it will end up looking like this: It is the same as before, with the only changes being lines 3 and 4, which represents an extra SubSource + Add Hits to check if 0xCANDIES - Delta 0xCANDIES = -98 , only to take care of this very minor exception just mentioned. And now it is solved!

Aunque algunos emuladores tienden a ignorar esta \u00e1rea o a emularla incorrectamente, se recomienda NO utilizarla para nada y siempre utilizar el primer resultado. El Game Boy tiene 8KB de RAM empezando en 0xC000. La ECHO RAM empieza en 0xE000, as\u00ed que si tus direcciones empiezan con una E vas a tener que remplazar el primer car\u00e1cter que no tenga un cero con una C. Recuerda: C es lo correcto, E es la echo! GBC link En el GBC, los 4KB de memoria de 0xD000-0xDFFF son un banco para un bloque de memoria mas grande de 32kb que no es directamente accesible por el procesador. Los Bits 0-2 de 0xFF70 indican cual banco esta cargado en el bloque de memoria 0xD000-0xDFFF. Es una \"funci\u00f3n\" utilizada para expandir el almacenamiento de los ROMs del GBC mientras aun se tiene el soporte para ROMs del GB original. Cambiar de Banco (cambiar el valor de 0xFF70) provoca que la memoria en el rango 0xD000-0xDFFF se actualice. Esto aparece como un flickering/parpadeando en el Visor de Memoria y provoca que la b\u00fasqueda de memoria sea mas complicada. Si estas escribiendo condiciones dependiendo de la memoria que se encuentra en ese bloque, tambi\u00e9n vas a requerir que 0xFF70 tenga un valor en especifico para asegurarte que estas utilizando el banco correcto. Los 4KB de memoria de 0xC000-0xCFFF no se cambian como el banco y pueden ser utilizados sin preocupaciones sin condiciones adicionales. No es muy recomendable que utilices estas direcciones en tus logros si es que cuentas con al menos una alternativa para no utilizarnos. Desde Enero del 2018, RALibretro solamente muestra el banco de 0x00 a 0xFF70. RetroArch a estado fluctuando los bancos de memoria, pero algunos valores no funcionan de la misma manera que en RAVisualBoyAdvance. Al menos asta que RetroArch reciba una inspector de memoria, logros que utilicen direcciones en 0xD000-0xDFFF solamente van a funcionar en RAVisualBoyAdvance. GB/GBC BIOS link RALibRetro y RetroArch cuenta con soporte para el BIOS de GB/GBC, que muestra los logos de \"Nintendo\" y \"GameBoy\" antes de empezar el juego. Esto provee aproximadamente cuatro segundo donde la memoria principal ($C000-$DFFF) aun no a sido inicializada, y podr\u00eda provocar que algunos logros se disparen cuando se cargue el juego por algunos usuarios que tienen el BIOS habilitado. Para habilitar esta caracter\u00edstica, pon el archivo del bios (de nombre gb_bios.bin o gbc_bios.bin ) en el folder del directorio del sistema ya sea el de RALibRetro o RetroArch. Cuando empieces el juego, vas a ver los logos de \"Nintendo\" y \"GameBoy\" antes de proceder al juego actual. Si esto te esta causando problemas, tal vez necesites agregar un poco de l\u00f3gica para prevenir que los logros salten cuando se encuentre el jugador en el BIOS, pero seria preferible que agregues l\u00f3gica del juego si es posible (ej. cuando se muestra una pantalla en especifico). El c\u00f3digo del BIOS es cargado en $0000-$00FF, as\u00ed que identifica ese pedazo de memoria cuando est\u00e9s en el BIOS y haz que lo ignore tu logro. Por ejemplo, los \u00faltimos cuatro bytes del bloque del BIOS del GBC son 3E 11 E0 50 , asi que podr\u00edas agregar esta condici\u00f3n al logro para prevenir que el logro salte cuando el BIOS se encuentra corriendo. 32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0113E Despu\u00e9s de que el BIOS se termina, el bloque es rellenado con puras FF's, y es re-asignado para vectores de interrupci\u00f3n. Para mas detalles, mira Un vistazo a la pantalla de inicio del GameBoy . NOTA : Los \u00faltimos cuatro bytes del BIOS del GB son 3E 01 E0 50 . As\u00ed que la condici\u00f3n para el BIOS seria: 32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0013E Nintendo 64 (RAP64) link Utilizando c\u00f3digos GameShark para Direcciones link Los c\u00f3digos de GameShark pueden ser un valioso recurso para encontrar direcciones que no puedes o sientes que no las puedes encontrar. Estos cuentan con 12 caracteres por linea y son sencillamente f\u00e1ciles de compilar. [AA][BBBBBB] [CCCC] [AA] es el tipo de c\u00f3digo. Esta es una peque\u00f1a instrucci\u00f3n para el GameShark que define que hacer con el siguiente valor. Si entiendes que es lo que hace ese c\u00f3digo GameShark puedes utilizar como ayuda para crear una condici\u00f3n. 80, 88: La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Pone el valor en [00CC] en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB]. 81, 89: La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Pone el valor en [CCCC] en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB]. D0: La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Checa si [00CC] es igual al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es. D2: La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Checa si [00CC] es DIFERENTE al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es. D1: La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Checa si [CCCC] es igual al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es. D3: La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Checa si [CCCC] es DIFERENTE al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es. Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n algunos ejemplos: * Paper Mario: HP Infinito: [80][10F292] [0032] Cambia el valor de 8-bit en 0x10F292 a 0x32 (50). Entonces esto significa que el HP de Mario es un valor de 8-bit en 0x10F292. Donkey Kong 64: Juega como Rambi: [80][74E77C] [0006] Cambia el valor de 8-bit en 0x74E77C a 6. Entonces esto significa que el personaje el cual estas utilizando ahora es un valor de 8-bit en 0x74E77C. Chameleon Twist 2: Deja presionado L para hacer el Moon Jump: [D0][18BAB5] [0020] <- Estamos revisando este [81][18B9E0] [4200] Checa si el valor de 8-bit en 0x18BAB5 es igual a 0x20. Esto significa que 0x18BAB5 contiene una variable de presionado de bot\u00f3n y el Bit5 (0x20) corresponde a la L. Anti-GSC y GameHacking los dos son buenos recursos para encontrar c\u00f3digos de GameShark. Neo Geo link Protecci\u00f3n Obligatoria del UniBIOS link UniBIOS permite severas opciones de desarrollador, y tambi\u00e9n accesa a la base de datos de cheats de cada juego. Por eso mismo todos los logros para Neo Geo necesitan estar protegidos de esto. La soluci\u00f3n mas simple para hacer esto es desabilitar el uso del UniBIOS completamente, directamente desde el c\u00f3digo de logro. Afortunadamente la parte de la data del UniBIOS parece ser reflejada en dos cadenas de direcciones en la RAM: 0x00fe30 y 0x00fe50 . Mientras el UniBIOS este activo 0x00fe30 en 32-bit parece mostrar siempre el mismo valor (para cada uno de los juegos de Neo Geo game) que es 80025632 , y no parece que cambie despu\u00e9s que el ROM ya fue cargado. Para cualquier otro BIOS, el valor siempre es 0, (excepto en el momento en el que la RAM es cargada de nuevo en el programa de diagnostico, despu\u00e9s de haber cargado el ROM). Para proteger tus logros del uso completo del UniBIOS lo \u00fanico que necesitamos hacer es incluir una simple protecci\u00f3n que se va resetear cuando el valor de 32-bit en 0x00fe30 no sea igual a 0 .

If you familiarize yourself with the quirks of your favorite console then set making will be easier and more accurate. NES (RANes) link Memory Mirroring link When using the memory inspector to find variables for NES games, there will be 4 copies of everything you find. If you're wondering \"which one do I use?\" or \"should I check for all of them?\" it's not as complicated as it seems. This is a feature of the NES that gave developers more ways of looking at memory. Because the NES itself only has 2KB of RAM, the first result (the one below 0x800) should be used for consistency, and applying additional conditions on the others will do nothing. This applies to RPS and leaderboards as well. Game Boy (RAVBA) link Memory Map link Certain ranges of values mean different things in the context of the Game Boy hardware, so having a map of what's where can help you with eliminating useless addresses. Here's the lowdown: \u274c 0x0000 - 0x7FFF: ROM Data (No reason to use. This area contains header information that's only read on certain emulators.) \u274c 0x8000 - 0x9FFF: Graphics Data (Some things here might correlate with what you're looking for if you're trying to find a map ID or animation, but there will always be a better way of going about what you're doing than using any of these) \u2714\ufe0f 0xA000 - 0xBFFF: Cartridge RAM (IE. save data. Sometimes using these addresses will be unavoidable but then your set could be prone to cheating by loading 100% save files. More info on protecting against save files to come) \u2714\ufe0f 0xC000 - 0xDFFF: Work RAM (The good stuff; almost everything you should use will fall inside this range) \u274c 0xE000 - 0xFDFF: ECHO RAM (Do not use, see below) \u274c 0xFE00 - 0xFE9F: More Graphics Data (same as Graphics Data above) \u274c 0xFEA0 - 0xFFFF: Miscellaneous (Do not use) For more info see: http://gameboy.mongenel.com/dmg/asmmemmap.html ECHO RAM link Similarly to the NES, certain variables may show up twice when searching in the Memory Inspector. The second result is in what's called the ECHO RAM, which is a mirror of the actual memory. Since some emulators tend to ignore this area or emulate it incorrectly, it's recommended to NOT use it at all and always use the first result. The Game Boy has 8KB of RAM starting at 0xC000. ECHO RAM starts at 0xE000, so if your address begins with an E you'll want to replace the first non-zero character with a C. Remember: C is correct, E is echo! GBC link On the GBC, the 4KB of memory from 0xD000-0xDFFF is a bank from a larger 32KB memory block not directly accessible by the processor. Bits 0-2 of 0xFF70 indicate which bank is loaded into the 0xD000-0xDFFF memory block. It's a \"feature\" used to expand the storage available to GBC ROMs while still supporting GB ROMs. Bank switching (changing the value of 0xFF70) causes the memory in the 0xD000-0xDFFF range to update. This appears as flickering in the Memory Viewer and makes tracking down values in that memory range difficult. If you are writing conditions dependent on memory in that block, you should also require that 0xFF70 have a specific value to ensure you are looking at the correct bank. The 4KB of memory from 0xC000-0xCFFF is not bank-switched and can be used safely without additional conditions. It is not advisable to use these addresses for achievements if there is any alternative to doing so. As of January 2018, RALibretro will only display bank 0x00 at 0xFF70. RetroArch has fluctuating memory banks, but the various addresses do not function in the same manner as RAVisualBoyAdvance. At least until RetroArch receives a memory inspector, achievements using addresses from 0xD000-0xDFFF will only work within RAVisualBoyAdvance. GB/GBC BIOS link RALibRetro and RetroArch support the GB/GBC BIOS, which shows the \"Nintendo\" and \"GameBoy\" logo before starting the game. This provides approximately four seconds where the main memory ($C000-$DFFF) hasn't been initialized and can't be trusted, and may cause achievements to trigger while loading the game for a subset of users who have the BIOS enabled. To enable this feature, put the bios file (named gb_bios.bin or gbc_bios.bin ) into the system directory of either RALibRetro or RetroArch. When you start the game, you will see the \"Nintendo\" and \"GameBoy\" logos before proceeding into the actual game. If this is causing you problems, you may need to add logic to prevent the achievements from triggering while the BIOS is executing, but it would be preferable to use in-game logic if possible (i.e. a specific screen is being displayed). The BIOS code is loaded from $0000-$00FF, so identify some chunk of that memory that's unique while the BIOS is running and ignore it. For example, the last four bytes of the GBC BIOS block are 3E 11 E0 50 , so you could add this condition to the achievement to prevent it from triggering while the BIOS is running. 32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0113E After the BIOS completes, the block is blanked out with FF's, and repurposed for interrupt vectors. For more detail, see A Look at the GameBoy bootstrap . NOTE : The last four bytes of the GB BIOS are 3E 01 E0 50 . So the GB condition would be: 32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0013E Nintendo 64 (RAP64) link Using GameShark Codes for Addresses link GameShark codes can be a valuable resource for finding addresses you can't or don't feel like finding. They have 12 characters per line and are fairly easy to parse. [AA][BBBBBB] [CCCC] [AA] is the codetype. This is a short instruction to the GameShark that defines what to do with the next value. If you understand what the GameShark code does you can use it to help with condition-making. 80, 88: The address is 8-bit. Sets the value [00CC] to the address [BBBBBB]. 81, 89: The address is 16-bit. Sets the value [CCCC] to the address [BBBBBB]. D0: The address is 8-bit. Checks if [00CC] is equal to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is. D2: The address is 8-bit. Checks if [00CC] is DIFFERENT to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is. D1: The address is 16-bit. Checks if [CCCC] is equal to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is. D3: The address is 16-bit. Checks if [CCCC] is DIFFERENT to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is. Here are some examples: * Paper Mario: Infinite HP: [80][10F292] [0032] Sets the 8-bit value at 0x10F292 to 0x32 (50). So this means Mario's HP is an 8-bit value at 0x10F292. Donkey Kong 64: Play as Rambi: [80][74E77C] [0006] Sets the 8-bit value at 0x74E77C to 6. So this means the character you're playing as is an 8-bit value at 0x74E77C. Chameleon Twist 2: Hold L to Moon Jump: [D0][18BAB5] [0020] <- Looking at this one [81][18B9E0] [4200] Checks if the 8-bit value at 0x18BAB5 is equal to 0x20. This means 0x18BAB5 contains a button press variable and Bit5 (0x20) corresponds to L. Anti-GSC and GameHacking are both good resources for finding GameShark codes. Neo Geo link Mandatory UniBIOS protection link UniBIOS allows several debugging options, and also access the database of individual cheats for every game. Therefore all achievements for Neo Geo need to be protected from abusing it. The simpliest solution here is disallowing UniBIOS usage completely, directly from the level of achievement code. Fortunately part of UniBIOS data seems to be reflected in two address strings in the RAM: 0x00fe30 and 0x00fe50 . While UniBIOS is active 0x00fe30 in 32-bit size seems to always brings the same value (for every Neo Geo game) which is 80025632 , and it doesn't seem to change after the ROM was loaded. For any other BIOS, the value is always 0, (except for the moment the RAM is overloaded by the diagnostic program, after the ROM was loaded). To protect achievements from using UniBIOS all we need to do is to include a simple protection which will reset when 0x00fe30 in 32-bit size is not equal to 0 . This additionally, eventually protect the achievement from unlocking during RAM diagnostic process. Here is how the protection should look alike (selected in the Achievement Editor): Here is how the same RAM region looks when other BIOS are used (here MSV): PlayStation link The RAM from $0000-$FFFF is reserved for the kernel. The boot executable name appears to reliably be placed at $9E18 AND $B8B0. The boot executable name almost always contains the disc serial, which is unique per region, so this can often be used to determine which version of a game the player is using.

Donkey Kong 64: Play as Rambi: [80][74E77C] [0006] Sets the 8-bit value at 0x74E77C to 6. So this means the character you're playing as is an 8-bit value at 0x74E77C. Chameleon Twist 2: Hold L to Moon Jump: [D0][18BAB5] [0020] <- Looking at this one [81][18B9E0] [4200] Checks if the 8-bit value at 0x18BAB5 is equal to 0x20. This means 0x18BAB5 contains a button press variable and Bit5 (0x20) corresponds to L.

Therefore all achievements for Neo Geo need to be protected from abusing it. The simpliest solution here is disallowing UniBIOS usage completely, directly from the level of achievement code. Fortunately part of UniBIOS data seems to be reflected in two address strings in the RAM: 0x00fe30 and 0x00fe50 . While UniBIOS is active 0x00fe30 in 32-bit size seems to always brings the same value (for every Neo Geo game) which is 80025632 , and it doesn't seem to change after the ROM was loaded. For any other BIOS, the value is always 0, (except for the moment the RAM is overloaded by the diagnostic program, after the ROM was loaded). To protect achievements from using UniBIOS all we need to do is to include a simple protection which will reset when 0x00fe30 in 32-bit size is not equal to 0 . This additionally, eventually protect the achievement from unlocking during RAM diagnostic process.

Todos los sets de logros estan abiertos para mejoras. Resumen - Los Desarrolladores tienen que seguir lo siguientes puntos para estar en buenos terminos link Cuando planees trabajar en un nuevo juego reservalo anunciando el plan basico en el foro del juego en un nuevo post. Solo anuncia nuevos planes cuando tu estes libre de tickets . Sigue las reglas de reservacion tambien. Espera 3 dias despues que hubieras posteado tus planes para promober cualquiera de los logros a core. Manten tu trabajo libre de conceptos-no bienvenidos . Usa codigo protectivo para prevenir cheating y exploits potenciales. Deja notas de codigo precisas para cada condicion de logro que utilices. Para revisiones de set, sigue la politica de revision . Resuelve tickets , y deja notas cada vez que lo hagas. Una vez que publiques tu trabajo, estas dejando que la comunidad rese\u00f1e y lo retrabaje a traves del tiempo . Antes de empezar link Estas libre de tickets? link Antes que trabajes en nuevos juegos tienes que resolver todos los tickets con los que cuentes. Una vez que estes libre tickets, entonces adelante. El juego esta presente en la base de datos? link No link Entonces pregunta para que sea agregado por medio de Discord #help-me o en nuestros foros para que algun desarrollador lo agregue por ti. Es esencial que tu elijas el ROM(s) correcto para trabajar . Si quieres trabajar en un hack, checa logros para hacks de ROM doc first. Si link Bien! adelante. El juego ya cuenta con un set de logros? link Yes link Si existe un set, no te rindas. Aun lo puede mejorar, agregando/removiendo/re-trabajando logros, o haz cambios a titulos e imagenes, etc. Sin embargo tendras que pasar por el proceso de revision de tu set . No link Busca delicadamente. Algunas veces hay multiples entradas en la base de datos para el mismo juego con diferente titulos. Una vez que este seguro, ahora necesitas checar si hay otro desarrollador trabajando en el juego. Nota: Solo un set de logros es permitido por el mismo juego y consola. Para detalles mira trabajando con el ROM correcto . Hay otros desarrollor trabajando en el juego? link Para estar seguro que no hay otro desarrollador trabajando en ese juego, checa el foro oficial del juego (esa es la manera oficial de reservar el juego en el que quieres trabajar ). Esto es necesario para evadir conflictos entre multiples desarrolladores trabajando en el mismo juego. Si link Podria ser posible que el desarrollor hubiera dejado de trabajar en ellos. Se espera que el desarrollador renueve su reservacion cada dos meses. Mira en las etiquetas de tiempo para ver cuando el desarrollador postio su reservacion de desarrollo. Si el desarrollador no a clarificado o renovado su reservacion despues de que hubieran pasado dos meses puedes asumir que fue abandonado y asi postear tus planes de trabajo. No link Perfecto! Adelante! El siguiente paso es anunciar tus planes para desarrollar logros para el juego. Anunciando tus planes para trabajar en un juego link Anunciar tus planes para el set de logros se hace en el foro oficial del juego del que tienes en mente crear el set. Postear tus planes es tu manera de reservar oficialmente un juego, sin embargo hay algunas reglas sobre el apartado sets que tienes que tener en cuenta. Notas Importantes link No hay necesidad de que dejes un plan completo y detallado! Simplemente una idea general de cuales son tus intenciones (tus planes son muy probables que cambien una vez que hubieras investigado la memoria del juego). Haz esto para que la comunidad pueda dejar recomendaciones y puede proveer retroalimentacion. Intenta estar abierto a recomendaciones. Si no estas de acuerdo con la retroalimentacion recivida, puedes continuar con tu concepto. Pero recuerda tener lo siguiente en mente: Tienes que aderirte al Reglamento de Dise\u00f1o Basico de Logros , de otra manera tu set no sera aprovado. Cuando tu publicas tu trabajo estas dejando a la comunidad para que sea rese\u00f1ado y re-trabajado sobre el paso del tiempo. Si alguien escogio un juego del cual tu estas interesado antes que tu, no te desesperes. Te animamos a solicitar una colaboraci\u00f3n. Puedes publicar tu deseos de colaborar en el foro o mandar un mensaje al desarrollador para obtener permiso para que publique tus contribuciones. Tambien puedes esperar e ir por una Revision de Set after the set is published. Reglas para reservar juegos para desarrollo link Las siguientes reglas existen para saber facilmente quien esta trabajando en que, definir que es aceptable, prevenir que el desarrollo de juegos no se estanque, proteger a los desarrolladores de indebida presion social. La unica manera de reservar un juego es posteando tu plan en el foro oficial del juego en un nuevo post . No otros planes o listas posteadas en cualquier otro luegar son consideradas en esto. Notas de codigo no reservan un juego (si agregaste notas pero no reservaste el juego en el foro, cualquier desarrollador es libre de trabajar en el). Numero maximo de juegos reservados a la vez: Desarrollador Junior : 1. Desarrollador : 4. Desarrollador Veterano : 8 (un Desarrollador Veterano es alguien que a sido un desarrollador por minimo 18 meses y a publicado un minimo de 20 sets de logros). Nota: Trabajar en una revision aprovada o unirte con otro desarrollador en un esfuerzo cooperativo no cuenta para este total. Solo reserva un juego para desarrollo cuando realmente ya vaz a empezar a trabajar en el. En otras palabras, no reserves juegos simplemenete para blockear otros usuarios en trabajar en ellos. Puedes renovar tu reservacion cada dos meses (+/- 2 semanas) si no haz terminado tu set aun. Para renovar tu reservacion, postealo en el foro oficial del juego. No edites tus antiguas declaraciones, haz un nuevo post hablando del progreso actual. Evita ignorar un set indefinidamente. Si parece que un desarrollador continua retrasando el desarrollo de un set con poco o sin progreso el staff puede intervenir. No pidas, presiones o desalentes a nadie en trabajar en cualquier juego, en publico o en privado (claramente, asumiendo que la persona esta siguiendo todos los otros estandartes de este Codigo de Conducta). Una vez que hubieras posteado tu plan, espera un minimo de 72 hours antes de promover cualquier logro a Core . Esto le da tiempo a la comunidad de renovar tu plan y dar retro-alimentacion. Este periodo de espera empieza despues que tu plan este presente y esta en su forma completa (o mayormente completa). Reglamento de Dise\u00f1o Basico de Logros link Conceptos No-Bienvenidos link Tu puedes (y deberias) se lo mas creativo que puedas, pero hay algunos conceptos que NO estan bienvenidos para logros, como: - Requirir el uso de glitches (aceptable en Sets Bonus ). - Requieren dos jugadores. - Requiere perfeccion por todo el juego ( talvez aceptable in Sets Bonus ). - Morir (simplemente), o juega mal sin ningun proposito. - Contenido no apropiado (NSFW) en la imagen o texto. - Logros saltando frecuentemente con poco esfuerzo del jugador (incluyendo multiples logros por hacer la misma tarea, como vencer al jefe y otro por conseguir el item que dejo el jefe , etc.) - Logros obtenibles con zero esfuerzo sin razon alguna (ejemplo: empieza el juego con x personaje, colecciona una moneda). Es acceptable si hay algo divertido/historico/interesante que quieres tocar. - Se requiere grinding repetitivo y excesivo, asi como llega a level 99 en un RPG, sin razon alguna ( talvez aceptable en Sets Bonus ). - Se basa completamente en suerte, especialmente cuando hay probabilidades realmente bajas. Sin embargo, para juegos que el factor aleatorio es un aspecto importante, podria ser apropiado. - \"Logros Secretos\", cuando los jugadores no tiene indicacion de que es lo que tienen que hacer. Si quieres prevenir spoilers da minimo una pista en el titulo o descripcion. De otra manera los jugadores van a empezar a buscar en la web o van a moverle al editor de Logros/Inspector de Memoria, y en el proceso pueden incluso toparse con peores spoilers. Con cada regla, hay un excepcion. Esta es especialmente verdad con conceptos no-bienvenidos. Todos los conceptos no-bienvenidos tienen un margen de aprovacion. cuando te encuentres en dudas puedes consultar con el equipo de administradores. Cada Set de logros TIENE que tener link Proteccion para situaciones donde los jugadores puedes conseguir logros sin esfuerzo, como: Modo Demo; Cheat codes en el juego; Archivos de guardado; Passwords. Tambien mira : Plantillas para logros y Ejemplos reales para algunas tecnicas de proteccion bien conocidas. Cada Set de logros DEBERIA tener link Minimo Rich Presence basico; Medallas (Badges) para cada Logro; Todo la informacion del juego llena, e imagenes del juego subidas. Nota : Rich Presence, Tablas de clasificacion, y paginas del juego imagenes/informacion solo pueden ser agregadas por verdaderos desarrolladores Recomendado pero no requerido por cada Set de logros link Tablas de clasificacion para puntajes y retos de tiempo. Logros Perdidisos flageados, especialmente para RPGs y juegos largos. Utiliza [m] al final del titulo del logro para flaggearlo como perdidiso. Una guia de logros. Guias pueden ser creadas y posteadas aqui . Herramientas para ayudarle a tener \u00e9xito link Tenemos un We have a mapa que puedes utilizar como guia para crear un buen set de logros. Tambien tenemos una guia de dise\u00f1o de logros en como dise\u00f1ar buenos logros, no el lado tecnico pero si el conceptual. Crear un set balanceado es uno de los aspectos mas dificiles de desarrollo, tenemos una guia de balance de dificultad que te podria ayudar en pensar como crear un set que fluya. Es preferible y recomendado trabajar en un set a la vez. Pero si tienes mas, ten abiertas posibilidades para trabajar en equipo o incluso delegar la creacion de un set si otro desarrollador te contacta. Revisiones - Trabajando en Sets que ya cuentan con logros link Revisiones, si estas trabajando en un set que ya cuenta con logros tipicamente requiere aprovacion por la comunidad, presentando tu plan en el foro y en el canal de #revision-voting en Discord. No todos los cambios requieren aprovacion. Mira Revisiones de Sets de Logros para mas detalles. Notas de Codigo link Deja notas precisas para cada valor que utilizes en un logro. Esto te ayuda a ti y a otros de mantener el set libre de bugs. Eres libre de agregar todos las notas que quieras en el juego sin incluso a ver declarado tus intenciones en trabajar en ese juego. Simplemente se cuidadoso en no borrar notas de codigo creadas por otros usuarios. Manejo de Tickets link Despues que hubieras publicado tus logros preparate para reportes de bugs. Se supone que tienes que dejar tu trabajo libre de bugs con el manejo de tickets y resolviendolos. Responde a todos los tickets lo mas pronto posible. Mientras mas pronto mejor, porque el problema esta fuera de la mente del jugador y puedes utilizarlo como ayuda para resolver el problema tambien. Mientras resuelves tickets, deja un peque\u00f1o resumen de lo que hiciste. Si tienes una indicacion o un reporte falso deja un mensaje cuales fueron tus conclusiones, y entonces cierra el ticket. Cerrar/Resolver un ticket sin dejar ningun comentario es una actitud no-bienvenida. No declares tus planes de trabajar en un juego si cuentas con tickets abiertos. Si tienes planeado resolver tickets o arreglar bugs en logros hechos por otro desarrollador, siempre es una buena practica intentar contactarlo si aun se encuentra activo antes de modificar su trabajo. Un desarrollador inactivo es alguien que cuenta con 10 o mas tickets abiertos y tienen un minimo de dos meses de antiguedad (puedes ver sus tickets abiertos desde el Ticket Manager). Si el desarrollador esta activo, puedes simplemente hecharle una ayuda con la solucion. Si el desarrollador esta inactivo puedes libremente resolverle sus tickets. Sin embargo solamente tienes permitido arreglar el logro con lo que dice en su descripcion; no cambies la intencion de logro sin haber pasado por el proceso de revision . Propiedad de los logros link Cuando tu publicas tu trabajo tu se lo estas dando a la comunidad para que sea rese\u00f1ado y re-trabajado con el paso del tiempo - mira Revisiones en un Set . Aunque los logros publicados por un desarrollador no son propiedad de el, el aun es el encargado en terminos de arreglar y dar mantenimiento. Si otro jugador corrige el logro el es el nuevo encargado de ese logro. Retroalimentacion sobre el Codigo de Conducta del Desarrollador link A pesar de que el Codigo de Conducta del Desarrollador es el resultado de un intenso debate, no es un documento absoluto. Si tiene sugerencias para nuevas mejoras, contactanos en nuestro servidor de Discord o manda un mensaje a RAdmin .

La unica manera de reservar un juego es posteando tu plan en el foro oficial del juego en un nuevo post . No otros planes o listas posteadas en cualquier otro luegar son consideradas en esto. Notas de codigo no reservan un juego (si agregaste notas pero no reservaste el juego en el foro, cualquier desarrollador es libre de trabajar en el). Numero maximo de juegos reservados a la vez: Desarrollador Junior : 1. Desarrollador : 4. Desarrollador Veterano : 8 (un Desarrollador Veterano es alguien que a sido un desarrollador por minimo 18 meses y a publicado un minimo de 20 sets de logros). Nota: Trabajar en una revision aprovada o unirte con otro desarrollador en un esfuerzo cooperativo no cuenta para este total. Solo reserva un juego para desarrollo cuando realmente ya vaz a empezar a trabajar en el. En otras palabras, no reserves juegos simplemenete para blockear otros usuarios en trabajar en ellos. Puedes renovar tu reservacion cada dos meses (+/- 2 semanas) si no haz terminado tu set aun. Para renovar tu reservacion, postealo en el foro oficial del juego. No edites tus antiguas declaraciones, haz un nuevo post hablando del progreso actual. Evita ignorar un set indefinidamente. Si parece que un desarrollador continua retrasando el desarrollo de un set con poco o sin progreso el staff puede intervenir. No pidas, presiones o desalentes a nadie en trabajar en cualquier juego, en publico o en privado (claramente, asumiendo que la persona esta siguiendo todos los otros estandartes de este Codigo de Conducta). Una vez que hubieras posteado tu plan, espera un minimo de 72 hours antes de promover cualquier logro a Core . Esto le da tiempo a la comunidad de renovar tu plan y dar retro-alimentacion.

If you are not a dev, check how to become a developer . See Also : Users Code of Conduct . Golden Rules link Respect your fellow developer and communicate through any issues you have civilly. Make room for other developers to get a chance to work on games they like, in their own way. Anyone can become a developer if they put in the effort. All achievement sets are open for improvement. Developers must do the following to keep in good standing: link When planning to work on a new game, reserve it by announcing your plan to work on it in a new post specific for that purpose. Only announce new plans when you are free of unaddressed tickets . Keep your work free from unwelcome concepts . Use protective code , preventing potential cheating and exploits. Leave accurate code notes for each achievement condition you use. For set revisions, follow the revision policy . Resolve tickets and leave notes each time you do. Like a wiki, once you publish your work, you are giving it over to the community to be reviewed and reworked over time . Developing a new achievement set link Before you begin working on a new achievement set go through the new achievement set checklist . Reserving a game for achievement development link 1. How to Reserve link The only way to reserve a game is by clearly stating your goal to create achievements in the official forum topic of the game on a new post exclusive for that purpose. No other declarations, plans or lists posted anywhere else are to be considered in this. Code notes do not reserve a game (if you have added notes but not reserved the game in the forum, any other developer is free to work on it). It is recommended that post a list of planned achievements, so the community can review your work and give you feedback. 2. Concurrent Reservations Limit link As in the maximum number of achievement sets one developer can have reserved at once. Junior Developer : 1. Developer : 4. Veteran Developer : 8 (a Veteran Developer is someone who has Developer status for at least 18 months and has published at least 20 achievement sets). Note: Joining another developer in a cooperative effort does not reduce from this total. 3. Reservation Timing link Only reserve a game for development when you start working on it. In other words, do not reserve games just to block others from working on it. Please reserve a set as soon as you begin working and not as you are finishing your work. 4. Reservation Renewals link You can renew your reservation every three months if you have not finished your set. To renew a reservation, simply state that you are still working on a game in the its official forum topic. This must be a new post specific for that purpose; editing your previous declaration is not a valid renewal. After renewing a reservation for a third time, a detailed progress report will be requested for each subsequent renewal. Avoid locking down a set indefinitely. If it appears a developer continues to delay development on a set with little or no progress, staff may intervene. If that happens the renewal of reservation will not be authorized for a period of 3 months. After this period, the developer will be allowed to reserve the set again if it is available. Once a reservation has expired, the set is not available to be claimed by another developer until an admin has stated in the forum topic that the set is open for development. If you feel the declaration was overlooked, please contact RAdmin . 5. Respecting Reservations link Do not ask, pressure or discourage anyone from working on any game, in public or in private (of course, assuming the person is already following all other standards on this Code of Conduct). 6. Reservation Cool-Down link Upon reserving a set, wait at least 24 hours before promoting it to core. This allows time for reservation review and to clear up any possible reservation disputes. If you believe a set is ready for core within 24 hours, an early promotion may be subject to approval. Important Notes link If you post a complete plan, be open to suggestions; you can get excellent input and suggestions this way. You must adhere to the Basic Achievement Design Guidelines , otherwise your set won't be allowed. When you publish your work you are giving it over to the community to be reviewed and reworked over time. Collaboration link Let others know if you welcome collaborators. If you've recently reserved a set and someone else voices desire to work on a set that you've reserved within the last 24 hours (beyond suggesting ideas), consider ways in which you can collaborate with them. If someone reserved a game you're interested in before you, don't get frustrated. You are encouraged to request collaboration. You can post your desire to collaborate in the forum or send them a message to get permission from them to publish your contributions. You can also wait and go through an Achievement Set Revision after the set is published. Basic Achievement Design Guidelines link Unwelcome Concepts link You can (and should) be as creative as you can, but there are some concepts that are NOT welcome for achievements, such as: Require Glitches/Bugs 1 (acceptable in Bonus sets ). Require two players (acceptable in \"Multi\" sets). Require perfection all game ( maybe acceptable in Bonus Sets ). Dying (simply), or playing bad without any purpose (acceptable for extra content like special cutscene). NSFW content in text or image. Achievements popping frequently with little effort from the player (including multiple achievements for doing the same task, such as one for beating a boss and another one for getting the item left by the boss, etc.) Achievements obtainable with zero effort for no meaningful purpose (example: start the game as character X, collect one coin, watch a video). It's acceptable if there's something fun/historical/interesting you want to address. Require excessive repetitive grinding, such as reaching level 99 in an RPG, for no meaningful purpose ( maybe acceptable in Bonus Sets ). Rely entirely on randomness, especially when there are extremely low odds. However, for games where the randomness is a major aspect, it may be appropriate. \"Secret Achievements\", where the players have no indication of what they're going after. If you want to prevent spoilers give at least a clue on the Achievement Title/Description. Otherwise the players will start to search on web or mess with Achievement Editor/Memory Inspector, and in the process they can stumble across even worse spoilers. Sets for games that lack gameplay (videos, music visualizers, jukeboxes, etc.) won't be accepted without explicit approval. Approval will be handled via a vote by those with developer status on the Discord server, and requires implementation of sufficiently creative concepts. Book sets are still allowed, but must be worth 0 points. 1) Glitches/Bugs are errors within a game's code which often cause unintended behavior. Examples are memory overflow, incorrectly loaded levels, and clipping into objects. Note : With every rule, there are exceptions. This is especially true with unwelcome concepts. All unwelcome concepts have some wiggle room, so when in doubt, consult with the admin team. Every Achievement Set MUST Have link All game page information filled out, and game images uploaded (if you're not a full-dev, send the images to the code-reviewers). Game Badges for each achievement (they don't need to be distinct from each other, just don't leave them blank). Content covering up to completion so long as the game can be beaten. Whether it be defeating the final boss, completing a first loop, or completing all puzzles, achievement sets that do not cover at least beating the game are deemed unfinished and therefore subject to demotion. Arcade-style games where the focus is on high scores (such as Pac-Man and Crystal Castles) are exempt from this rule. Protection for situations where the players can get achievements without effort, such as: Demo mode; In-game cheat codes; Battery saves; Passwords. See also : Achievement Templates and Real Examples for some well known protection techniques. Recommended but not required link Basic Rich Presence (only available for full-devs). Leaderboards for scores and time challenges (only available for full-devs). Missable achievements flagged, especially for RPGs and long games. Use [m] in the end of achievement's title to flag it as missable. An achievement guide. Guides can be created and posted here . For games with text-triggered achievements (especially RPGs) it's recommend to find an event flag instead of hooking onto text or text ID. Text presentation varies between regional versions making multi-region support difficult. Achievement Scoring link When scoring achievements match your scores to one of these 5 tiers. There is no achievement set point cap. 0-5 Easy / Minor Significance 10 Medium / Intermediate Significance 25 Hard / Major Significance 50 Very Hard / Completion Level Significance 100 Sadistic (Typically for bonus sets) When scoring there are other factors to be considered , such as achievement spread and game length. Tools to Help you Succeed link We have a roadmap you can use as a guideline to create a good achievement set. We also have an achievement design guide on how to design good achievements, not the technical side but the conceptual. Creating a balanced set is one of the most difficult aspects of development, we have a set balance guide which will help you in thinking about how to create a set that flows. It is preferable and recommended to work on one set at a time. But if you have more, be open for a teamwork or even delegate the set creation if another dev contacts you. Revisions - Working on Sets with Existing Achievements link Revisions, as in working on a set that has existing achievements typically requires community approval by presenting your plan in the forum and in the #revision-voting channel in Discord. Not all changes need approval. See Achievement Set Revisions for details. Code Notes link Leave accurate code notes for each address you use for achievement conditions. This helps you and others maintain the set, keeping it free of bugs. You're free to add any code notes you discover to any set without declaring intentions to work on the game. Just be careful to not delete previous notes added by someone else. Handling Tickets link After you've published achievements be prepared for bug reports. You're expected to keep your work bug free by appropriately resolving tickets. Respond to all tickets as soon as possible. The sooner you respond the better, cause the problem is fresh in the player's mind and you can use them to help you to resolve the problem. While resolving tickets, leave a brief summary of what you did. If you have an indication of false report leave a message showing what conclusions you've made, and then close the ticket. Closing/Resolving a ticket without leaving any comments is an unwelcome attitude. Do not declare your plans to work on a game if you have unaddressed tickets. A ticket is considered as addressed when the developer acknowledeged the ticket, commented on it explaning the situation but is unable to resolve the problem immediately due to reasons such as waiting for saves states or more information from the reporter. If you want to resolve tickets or fix bugs on achievements made by another developer, it's always a good practice to try to contact them and check if they are still active before changing their work. An inactive developers is someone who have have 10 or more open tickets that are older than two months (you can see their open tickets from the Ticket Manager). If the developer is active, you can assist them in the resolution. If the developer is inactive you can freely resolve their tickets. However you're only allowed to fix the achievement to match the description; do not change the intention of the achievement without going through the revision process . Developer Status Extended Inactivity link If a developer is inactive for six months or longer, meaning within six months they have not created any new achievements or resolved any incoming tickets, their developer status will expire. If this happens to you, you are very welcome to come back to the scene if you want to create new content for our community. First you'll want to review and understand this document (the Developer Code of Conduct). When you feel ready to adhere to it, message us to user RAdmin (a shared admin mail account) here on site or speak to the admin or mod users on the RetroAchievements Discord server to check how to get your developer status back. Achievement Ownership link When you publish your work you are giving it over to the community to be reviewed and reworked over time - see Achievement Set Revisions . While the original developer does not own published achievements they are still the caretaker in terms of bug fixing and maintenance. If another developer revises the achievement they are the new caretaker of that achievement. Feedback about the Developer Code of Conduct link Although the Developer Code of Conduct is the result of an intense debate, it's not an immutable document. If you have suggestions for improvements, contact us on our Discord server or send a message to RAdmin .

Require two players (acceptable in \"Multi\" sets). Require perfection all game ( maybe acceptable in Bonus Sets ). Dying (simply), or playing bad without any purpose (acceptable for extra content like special cutscene). NSFW content in text or image. Achievements popping frequently with little effort from the player (including multiple achievements for doing the same task, such as one for beating a boss and another one for getting the item left by the boss, etc.) Achievements obtainable with zero effort for no meaningful purpose (example: start the game as character X, collect one coin, watch a video). It's acceptable if there's something fun/historical/interesting you want to address. Require excessive repetitive grinding, such as reaching level 99 in an RPG, for no meaningful purpose ( maybe acceptable in Bonus Sets ). Rely entirely on randomness, especially when there are extremely low odds. However, for games where the randomness is a major aspect, it may be appropriate. \"Secret Achievements\", where the players have no indication of what they're going after. If you want to prevent spoilers give at least a clue on the Achievement Title/Description. Otherwise the players will start to search on web or mess with Achievement Editor/Memory Inspector, and in the process they can stumble across even worse spoilers. Sets for games that lack gameplay (videos, music visualizers, jukeboxes, etc.) won't be accepted without explicit approval. Approval will be handled via a vote by those with developer status on the Discord server, and requires implementation of sufficiently creative concepts. Book sets are still allowed, but must be worth 0 points. 1) Glitches/Bugs are errors within a game's code which often cause unintended behavior. Examples are memory overflow, incorrectly loaded levels, and clipping into objects. Note : With every rule, there are exceptions. This is especially true with unwelcome concepts.

Whether it be defeating the final boss, completing a first loop, or completing all puzzles, achievement sets that do not cover at least beating the game are deemed unfinished and therefore subject to demotion. Arcade-style games where the focus is on high scores (such as Pac-Man and Crystal Castles) are exempt from this rule.

Closing/Resolving a ticket without leaving any comments is an unwelcome attitude. Do not declare your plans to work on a game if you have unaddressed tickets. A ticket is considered as addressed when the developer acknowledeged the ticket, commented on it explaning the situation but is unable to resolve the problem immediately due to reasons such as waiting for saves states or more information from the reporter. If you want to resolve tickets or fix bugs on achievements made by another developer, it's always a good practice to try to contact them and check if they are still active before changing their work. An inactive developers is someone who have have 10 or more open tickets that are older than two months (you can see their open tickets from the Ticket Manager).

Ejemplos: Empezar el juego, seleccionar un personaje, coleccionar un \u00edtem facil de conseguir, vencer a tu primer enemigo. 1 - Facil link La mayor\u00eda de jugadores lo pueden conseguir en su primer intento, Algunos en su segundo o tercero. Raramente los jugadores pueden arruinarlo. Ejemplo: Progresa en stages f\u00e1ciles, consigue 100 monedas, colecciona una pluma, colecciona 20 anillos.

Exemplos: Conseguindo todos os switches coloridos no Super Mario World, coletando todos os itens em uma fase de Castlevania, conseguindo um item b\u00f4nus em uma \u00e1rea mais escondida como as lua em SMW.

Deve-se pensar na dificuldade geral do set ao constru\u00ed-lo. N\u00e3o se deve tornar os set excessivamente dif\u00edceis. Um bom equil\u00edbrio nas 50 conquistas em um set m\u00e9dio teria aproximadamente: 4 Brindes, 6 super f\u00e1ceis. 10 m\u00e9dios, 10 medianos, 14 dif\u00edceis, 6 Muito dif\u00edceis e 0 kaizo. Uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de dificuldade bem balanceada tem recompensas para todos os tipos de jogadores. Isso se d\u00e1 a cada n\u00edvel de habilidade algo para realizar at\u00e9 a platina. Conquistas n\u00e3o devem ser apenas uma marca de conclus\u00e3o de um jogo , (muito f\u00e1cil) mas crie divertidas novas mem\u00f3rias para o jogo (diversividade de desafios). Isto deixa espa\u00e7o para os brindes que est\u00e3o apresentando elementos curiosos ou divertidos dos jogos. Isto lhe espera dificuldade suficiente que, uma vez que voc\u00ea platina o set, voc\u00ea \u00e9 o mestre do jogo. Mas isso n\u00e3o pede muito do jogador. Tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o deve ser pedir ao jogador para fazer coisas aparentemente sem fim e repetitivas para fazer um set parecer dif\u00edcil. Fazendo a mesma tarefa denovo e denovo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 dif\u00edcil, \u00e9 tipicamente tedioso. Deve quase sempre evitar fazer tipos de maratonas com uma \"colina\" no final (Aquelas que requer um longo tempo ou dificuldade repetitiva com e depois uma eleva\u00e7\u00e3o de alta dificuldade no final. N\u00e3o fa\u00e7a isso!) Sets dever\u00e3o ser platin\u00e1veis por um jogador h\u00e1bil que d\u00e1 um esfor\u00e7o dedicado. Sets dever\u00e3o refletir o conte\u00fado do jogo. Farmar conquistas em jogos que exigem Farm s\u00e3o razo\u00e1veis, em outros lugares eles seriam fequentemente inapropriados Sets dever\u00e3o tambem quebrar o que \u00e9 esperado de um jogo, impulsionando o jogador a procurar encontrar novas solu\u00e7\u00f5es para problemas que um jogador veterano nunca considerou","title":"Escala de Dificuldade"},{"location":"Difficulty-Scale-and-Balance-pt_BR/#quantidade-de-conquistas","text":"A quantidade de conquistas n\u00e3o tem regras t\u00e3o duras.

What you're going to see here are not rules, just suggestions. Note : be aware of Developers Code of Conduct Difficulty Scale: link Freebie Easy Medium Med-hard Hard Very-Hard Super-Hard More details on these at the bottom . In general there should be an steady sloping balance of difficulty. One should think of the overall difficulty of a set while building it. One should not make sets excessively difficult. A good set balance on a 50 cheeves in an average set would have roughly: 4 freebies, 6 easy cheeves, 10 medium, 10 med-hard, 14 hard, and 6 very-hard, 0 kaizo. A well balanced difficulty distribution has rewards for every type of player. It gives each skill level something to accomplish until mastery. Achievements should not just be a check-mark of completing a game , (too easy) but create fun new memories for the game (diversity of challenges). It leaves space for freebies that are featuring curious or fun elements of the game. It expects enough difficulty that once you've mastered the set you are a master of the game. But it doesn't ask too much from the player either. It also shouldn't ask the player to be doing seemingly endless repetitive grinding to make a set seem harder. Doing the same task over and over isn't hard, it's typically dull. It should almost always avoid making marathon types with a hill at the end (ones that require long setup times with low or repetitive difficulty and then a spike of high difficulty at the end. Don't do it!). Sets should be mastereable by a skilled player who gives a dedicated effort. Sets should reflect the content of the game. Grinding cheeves in games that require grinding are reasonable, where in other places they would often be inappropriate. Sets should also break out of just what is expected from a game, pushing the player to need to find new solutions for problems a veteran player never considered. Set Quantity: link Set quantity should not have such hard rules. Quality is the key factor. The set quantity strongly depends on how much fun and challenges the game can give. That's why the set developer must know the game very well. Set Variety: link Keep it fun, give it variety, challenge the player, give the player new things to do. Some achievements can give much fun to the player when they are like a meta-game. Where the player is required to rethink the game entirely. Some notable examples: Fabulous ComboFabulous Combo (15) - it turns the game into a puzzle game, completing this can be really satifying Swordless Adventurer (20) - with no sword you are forced to rethink the entire game. You can discover how useful all the subweapons are. Very fun! There Are No Bullets in the Energy Zone (10) - pacifist challenges, when possible force a lot more agility from the player and break old habits. Very fun! Definitions of Difficulty link 0 - freebie link Takes almost no effort for basically all players to achieve this OR the player gets it without any conscious effort. The player gets these on accident and they pop up on the screen. Sometimes the player will have no idea why they earned them. Some freebies are good some are bad. Examples: Starting the game, picking a character, collecting an easily accessible item, killing your first enemy. Stumbling on a cheeve that took no forethought but highlights elements of the game. 1 - Easy link Most players could get these on their first attempt, Some on their second or third attempt. Rarely players can mess it up. Examples: Progress on easy stages, getting 100 coins, collecting a feather, collecting 20 rings. Getting the first upgrade, getting to a well known secret stage. Fighting a simple boss: most bosses in Super Mario World, completing early stages in Sonic. 2 - Medium link Many players could get this on their first attempt. Many could after a few attempts. Some will need to practice. Very few will struggle with them. Examples: Getting all the colored switches in Super Mario World, collecting all of the items in a Castlevania stage, getting a bonus item in a more hidden area, like moons in SMW. Beating Contra with the Konami code. 3 - Medium-Hard link A low amount of players could get this on their first attempt. Some after a few attempts and most will take some effort and practice to complete these. A few will find them very challenging, and give up. Examples: Getting some of the chaos emeralds in Sonic 2. Beating Super Mario World. 4 - Hard link Very few player can get these on their first attempt, perhaps if they already know the game (not really a first attempt is it?) Most can complete these with a solid effort, many attempts and some practice, and some need to practice other games first. Examples: Getting all of the Chaos emeralds in Sonic 1,2,3. Beating Contra without the Konami code. 5 - Very Hard link Only the rarest of players can complete these on a first attempt. Most can complete it after many attempts, Many players will drop off here and won't be willing to complete the set unless they are completionists or fans of the game. Many are not able to complete this after very many attempts. Usually takes significant practice, high skills, experience, research, or guides to complete. Examples: Beating Contra in one life. Escaping Zebes (Super Metroid) in under two minutes. Beating many of the Megaman bosses without taking damage. Many damagless stages, depending on the game. 6 - Super Hard link Most players are not able to complete this after dozens of attempts. Many players will never be able to complete it as it could require beyond normal reaction speeds. The top-most skilled players still consider these blisteringly hard. It may take marathon efforts to restart. Examples: Completing a game without taking damage especially if the player has a lifebar, challenges that drastically restrict the player and require near frame perfect accuracy tor success. Beating contra twice in one life. Penniless plumber. Beating Megaman without taking damage.

This is primarily a set of guidelines to ensure the interaction between the emulator and the toolkit is consistent between emulators. If the system is supported by RetroArch, explain why a standalone emulator is desirable. RetroArch support is preferred as it is usable by more players (i.e. not just Windows users), and adding support to RALibRetro for an additional core is much easier than overhauling an entire emulator. Game Identification link Hash method documented and approved If emulator supports dynamic patching [i.e. ips], hash is calculated after applying patch Hash ignores any persistent save data [SRAM] Game can be properly identified (RA_OnLoadNewRom and/or RA_IdentifyROM + RA_ActivateGame) Unidentified game provides some descriptor [typically filename] to unknown game dialog (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_GetEstimatedGameTitle) Unidentified game provides list of known games for console (RA_SetConsoleID - which is usually called by RAIntegration in the emulator registration) Emulator link DLL is downloaded if not available (RA_Init - new EmulatorID enum value may be needed in RA_Interface.h) RetroAchievements menu is visible (RA_CreatePopupMenu) and functional (RA_InvokeDialog) RetroAchievements menu updates when logging in/out (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_RebuildMenu) Login dialog displayed on first run or auto-login on future runs (RA_AttemptLogin) Title includes logged in user (RA_UpdateAppTitle) RALog.txt ends with \"Shutdown complete\" after closing emulator (RA_Shutdown) Full-window overlay can be displayed (RA_SetPaused) Full-window overlay can be navigated (RA_NavigateOverlay) Full-window overlay navigation uses player's custom controller bindings, not hard-coded inputs. Closing the full-window overlay unpauses the emulator (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_CauseUnpause) Overlay is still functional when toggling full-screen mode (RA_UpdateHWnd) Resetting the emulator disables any active popups/leaderboards (RA_OnReset) Performance of emulator (without any debugging windows open) should not be noticeably different than the source emulator at 100% speed Emulator must perform at intended framerate on a PC that could have been purchased at a retail store within the last four years. Emulated System link Memory mapping method is documented and approved (RA_InstallMemoryBank) Modifying memory affects the game (RA_InstallMemoryBank>pWriter) Achievements/Leaderboards/Rich Presence link Achievements can be created Achievements trigger (RA_InstallMemoryBank>pReader, RA_DoAchievementsFrame) Achievement trigger displays notification Achievement can pause emulator [Pause on Reset, Pause on Trigger] (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_CausePause) Achievements are not processed when emulator is paused [HitCount for true condition does not increment] (RA_DoAchievementsFrame not called when paused) When using frame advance, achievements are only processed when the frame is advanced. Changing the current game prompts the user to save modifications (RA_ConfirmLoadNewRom) Choosing not to save modifications aborts changing the current game. Closing the emulator prompts the user to save modifications (RA_ConfirmLoadNewRom) Choosing not to save modifications aborts closing the emulator. Closing the current game prompts the user to save modifications (RA_ConfirmLoadNewRom) Choosing not to save modifications aborts closing the current game. Closing the current game clears the list of achievements for the game (RA_ActivateGame(0)) Softcore link Save states can be created Save states can be loaded HitCounts persist with save state (RA_OnSaveState, RA_OnLoadState) Speed may be adjusted above 100% [framerate higher than normal] Speed may be adjusted below 100% [framerate lower than normal] Fast-forward [removing frame limiter] is allowed Rewind is allowed Frame advance is allowed Overlay should not be displayed when using frame advance (don't call RA_SetPaused) Recording is allowed Recording playback is allowed Switching to Hardcore resets the emulator (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_ResetEmulation) Switching to Hardcore resets the emulator speed to 100% Switching to Hardcore closes any emulator specific tools for viewing/modifying memory Switching to Hardcore disables any enabled cheats Hardcore link Save states can be created Save states cannot be loaded [prompt to switch to softcore (RA_WarnDisableHardcore)] Speed may be adjusted above 100% Speed cannot be adjusted below 100% Fast-forward is allowed Rewind is not allowed Frame advance is not allowed Recording is allowed Recording playback is not allowed Switching to Softcore does not reset the emulator Emulator specific tools for viewing/modifying memory are not allowed [prompt to switch to softcore optional] Emulator specific tools for supporting cheats are not allowed [prompt to switch to softcore optional] Ensure any features not allowed in hardcore are disabled both from menu items and hotkeys After approval link Version generated from git tag Zip file needs to be built - should contain emulator, default Overlay directory, and any supplemental files needed by the emulator Backend (to be done by the RAWeb team) Add the emulator's console ID as a \"valid\" console, so new achievements can be promoted to the Core set (RAWeb:lib/database/game.php>isValidConsoleId). Add the emulator's enum (get the number from RAInterface.h and add it in RAWeb:src/Emulators.php) dorequest.php>latestclient needs to map to LatestXXXVersion.html file when it receives either emulator ID or console ID. Add link to the new system game list in RAWeb:lib/dynrenderer.php>RenderToolbar. Add an entry for the emulator in RAWeb:public/reportissue.php, so people can choose it when opening tickets.

Los logros son hechos por y para la comunidad. Ofrecemos varios emuladores personalizados para su uso, que detectar\u00e1n cuando hayas completado varios desaf\u00edos. Una vez que hayas iniciado sesi\u00f3n, los emuladores publicar\u00e1n los logros que hayas completado en el sitio, para que puedas verificar y comparar tu progreso con el de tus amigos. Aqu\u00ed hay un ejemplo de RAGens, jugando Streets of Rage 2. Ver\u00e1s dos contadores de intentos de tabla de clasificaci\u00f3n (abajo a la derecha), un logro desbloque\u00e1ndose y finalmente la interfaz (Overlay, presionando ESC): \u00bfQu\u00e9 emulador necesito usar? link Los emuladores oficiales de RetroAchievements.org son todos basados en Windows. Para otros sistemas operativos, puedes usar RetroArch. M\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n a continuaci\u00f3n: Emuladores oficiales de RetroAchievements.org link Descarga el emulador de tu elecci\u00f3n en la p\u00e1gina de descargas , inicia sesi\u00f3n con tu nombre de usuario y contrase\u00f1a (s\u00ed, primero debes crearte una cuenta), luego carga una ROM \u00a1y juega! \u00bfC\u00f3mo accedo a la interfaz (Overlay) de logros? link Normalmente, esto se configurar\u00e1 en la tecla de teclado 'ESC' o en la funci\u00f3n de pausa del juego. En la mayor\u00eda de los emuladores, un juego debe estar activo para que funcione. Algunos de los emuladores ya deber\u00edan estar configurados asignando un bot\u00f3n de controlador para ver la interfaz de logros. Generalmente 'ESC' en el teclado debe activarlo, pero si deseas asignarlo a un control, aqu\u00ed hay algunos trucos para algunos de los emuladores oficiales: Para RAVBA, ir a Tools > Customize y asignar FilePause a un bot\u00f3n. Para RASNES, ir a Input > Customize Hotkeys y cambiar Pause/Overlay en la p\u00e1gina 1. Para RANES, ir a Config > Map Hotkeys y cambiar Pause a un bot\u00f3n ( Nota : esto puede bloquear el emulador, es mejor hacerlo sin una ROM cargada para tener mejores oportunidades). Emulador RetroArch link Para sistemas operativos que no sean Windows, debes usar el emulador RetroArch . Actualmente se pueden obtener logros a trav\u00e9s de RetroArch en las siguientes plataformas: Windows Linux Mac Android (\u00a1s\u00ed, puedes conseguir logros mientras viajas con tu tel\u00e9fono Android!) PlayStation Vita (necesita estar pirateado con HENkaku ) PlayStation 3 Wii U Raspberry Pi (Sistemas recomendados: RetroPie , lakka y RecalBox ) Se puede obtener RetroArch en los siguientes enlaces: stable nightly Una vez que lo hayas instalado y hecho la configuraci\u00f3n inicial, sigue esta gu\u00eda para configurar los logros: https://libretro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/retroachievements/ \u00bfQu\u00e9 n\u00facleo (Core) RetroArch deber\u00eda usar? link Hay que tener en cuenta que no todos los n\u00facleos (Core) de RetroArch son compatibles con RetroAchievements. Consulta esta lista para ver cu\u00e1l elegir . \u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo ver la insignia (Badge) cuando gano un logro en RetroArch? link Esta funci\u00f3n fue implementada en RetroArch 1.7.7 (May/2019), aunque aun hay algunas plataformas en las que aun no funciona (como en el PS Vita). Simplemente necesitas percatarte que la opci\u00f3n de Menu Widget este habilitada (que usualmente lo esta por default). RetroArch/RALibretro no corre mi juego de arcade. \u00bfQue tengo que hacer? link Primero lo primero : percatate de estar utilizando el n\u00facleo de RetroArch correcto. Checa aqui cual nucleo deberias de utilizar para poder utilizar la funci\u00f3n de RetroAchievements en juegos de arcade: https://libretro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/retroachievements/#arcade Segundo punto : Los ROMs de Arcade son mas complicados que los de consolas. Hay algunos conceptos y terminologias que necesitas entender y asi todo va a empezar a tener sentido. Aqu\u00ed hay un buen texto en ingles sobre este tema: Demystifying MAME ROMs . Tip Pro : utiliza tu motor de b\u00fasqueda preferido para buscar un \"set de referencia\" (utilizar ROMs de manera aleatoria de diferentes fuentes es un m\u00e9todo de \"prueba y error\" y lo mas probable es que te frustres demasiado). \u00bfSer\u00e1 RetroAchievements compatible con PlayStation? link Respuesta mem\u00e9tica: Cada vez que alguien pregunta sobre los logros de PSX, el desarrollo se retrasa un mes m\u00e1s. Asi que por favor, \u00a1DEJA DE PREGUNTAR! Respuesta corta: Si, lo ser\u00e1, pero aun no hay una fecha estimada para su llegada. Respuesta larga: El m\u00e9todo actual de creaci\u00f3n de logros tiene limitaciones que influyen directamente en la calidad de los logros. Los juegos de PlayStation son un poco m\u00e1s complejos que los de las consolas que ya son compatibles aqu\u00ed (excepto quiz\u00e1s, los de Nintendo 64). Y en consecuencia, los logros de los juegos de PS merecen una mayor elaboraci\u00f3n y cuidado. Todos tenemos un gran respeto por la consola de PlayStation, y esa es exactamente la raz\u00f3n por la que queremos implementar mejoras en el kit de herramientas utilizado para crear logros antes de agregar este soporte. Nota: si encuentras cualquier otro sitio con logros para PlayStation, ten en cuenta que no esta asociado con RetroAchievements. \u00a1Mi correo electr\u00f3nico de bienvenida se ha perdido! link Lamentablemente, es sabido que algunas veces se pierde el correo electr\u00f3nico de bienvenida. Si esto sucede, inicia sesi\u00f3n con tu nombre de usuario/contrase\u00f1a con el que te registraste, luego visita tu p\u00e1gina de configuraci\u00f3n. En la parte superior, encontrar\u00e1s la opci\u00f3n de volver a enviar tu correo electr\u00f3nico de registro. \u00bfDonde puedo encontrar ROMs? link Aqu\u00ed no. Lamentablemente, es ilegal alojar o distribuir ROMs con derechos de autor. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 mi juego no est\u00e1 cargando sus logros? link Ya sea: No tiene logros. Es la ROM incorrecta. Una buena pr\u00e1ctica es verificar el tema oficial del foro del juego. Si a\u00fan no tienes una respuesta, consulta esta p\u00e1gina aqu\u00ed para m\u00e1s detalles: Mi juego no esta cargando los logros . \u00bfQu\u00e9 es el modo \"Hardcore\"? link El modo Hardcore es una caracter\u00edstica adicional para separar a los buenos jugadores de los grandes jugadores: el modo Hardcore desactiva toda forma de salvado y cargado (savestates) en el emulador: no podr\u00e1s guardar y volver a cargar en cualquier momento. Tendr\u00e1s que completar el juego y obtener los logros la primera vez, al igual que en la consola original. En recompensa por esto, ganar\u00e1s tanto el logro est\u00e1ndar como el logro en modo Hardcore, en efecto, \u00a1ganando el doble de puntos! \u00a1Un juego que normalmente vale 400 puntos, vale 800 puntos si lo completas exitosamente en el modo Hardcore! Por ejemplo: si completas el juego por completo con 400 puntos, entonces tienes la oportunidad de ganar otros 400 en el modo Hardcore. Si quieres jugar con el modo Hardcore desactivado (tambi\u00e9n conocido como \"softcore\"), podr\u00e1s tener algunos problemas. M\u00e1s detalles aqu\u00ed: Why you shouldn't use the load state feature \u00a1No obtuve este logro! (o lo obtuve en un momento equivocado) link Hay una caracter\u00edstica incorporada solo en los emuladores oficiales (no en RetroArch) que permite informar sobre logros rotos que se obtienen en el momento equivocado, o que no se obtienen del todo. Ir a RetroAchievements -> Report Broken Achievements . Ejemplo: . Tambi\u00e9n hay una forma de informar sobre logros rotos directamente a trav\u00e9s del sitio web. En la p\u00e1gina de cada logro, hay un enlace que dice Report an issue for this achievement , como en la imagen a continuaci\u00f3n: Agrega detalles del estado de tu juego, cu\u00e1ndo se activ\u00f3/no se activ\u00f3 el logro, en qu\u00e9 modo de juego ocurri\u00f3, d\u00f3nde estabas cuando sucedi\u00f3/no sucedi\u00f3, si reseteaste el juego recientemente, o cualquier otra cosa que creas que pueda ser relevante para el logro. Esto es necesario para nuestro sistema, para que los desarrolladores sepan d\u00f3nde esta el problema. Complet\u00e9 un logro dif\u00edcil pero no se activ\u00f3, \u00bfse me puede desbloquear manualmente? link S\u00ed. Pero debes seguir los siguientes pasos: Envia un ticket describiendo con detalles el problema que tuvo con el logro. Mira la pregunta/respuesta anterior para saber c\u00f3mo enviar un ticket. Si el logro no se registr\u00f3 en el sitio debido a un problema de red, no es necesario que envie un ticket. Obt\u00e9n una prueba/evidencia de que completaste el logro ( ejemplo perfecto de evidencia proporcionado por gr1nya ). Pruebas aceptables : Capturas de pantalla que muestran que estas jugando en Hardcore y has completado el logro. Un video de aquello (mucho mejor) . Ejemplos de logros que has obtenido que reemplazan o superan este logro, por ejemplo, obtuviste el logro de 10.000 puntos, pero no el de 5.000 puntos. Publ\u00edcalo en el canal #help-me de nuestro Servidor de Discord , mencionando a alg\u00fan @admin u otro usuario con el rol de admin, proporcionando la siguiente informaci\u00f3n: En enlace a la p\u00e1gina del logro En que modo estabas jugando (hardcore/softcore) El enlace a la evidencia (captura de pantalla, video, etc.) \u00a1Yo tambi\u00e9n quiero hacer logros! link \u00a1Es bueno escuchar eso! El mejor lugar para empezar es aqui: Getting Started as an Achievement Developer . Una vez que est\u00e9s familiarizado con el Memory Inspector y otros di\u00e1logos relacionados con los logros, puedes ir al resto de los Developer Docs . Por favor, no dudes en preguntar si necesitas ayuda, \u00a1no luches! Lo m\u00e1s importante es asegurarte de que est\u00e1s disfrutando lo que sea que est\u00e9s haciendo. Si no te est\u00e1s divirtiendo, no lo hagas. Pero si te sientes frustrado y quieres persistir, simplemente deja caer un mensaje en los foros o en el Servidor de Discord y alguien se comunicar\u00e1 contigo en breve. \u00bfQue son los Puntos Blancos (White points)? link Los puntos blancos (White points) son secundarios seg\u00fan lo dif\u00edcil que sea un logro. Explicado en detalle aqu\u00ed . \u00bfQu\u00e9 se considera hacer trampa (para el Hardcore)? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si encuentro evidencia de un tramposo? link Explotaci\u00f3n de conjuntos de logros y alteraci\u00f3n o modificaci\u00f3n deliberada de juego, emulador, memoria, velocidad (avance r\u00e1pido) o conjunto. Cargar bater\u00edas grabadas para obtener logros fuera de lugar sin ganarlos durante el juego normal. Se prohiben todas las trampas de los juegos, a menos que se especifique en la descripci\u00f3n o los comentarios del logro en la p\u00e1gina del logro. Vivimos por un c\u00f3digo de honor m\u00e1s que nada. Si encuentras evidencia de un tramposo, env\u00eda la evidencia a RAdmin , o env\u00eda un correo electr\u00f3nico a RAmodmail@gmail.com . \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si obtengo un logro que no gan\u00e9? link Lo mismo ocurre con no obtenerlo cuando deber\u00eda, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, querr\u00e1s crear un informe de ticket (ver arriba), dejando una explicaci\u00f3n de lo que sali\u00f3 mal. Tambi\u00e9n querr\u00e1s eliminar estos logros de tu cuenta, para que puedas tener la satisfacci\u00f3n de realmente ganarlos por ti mismo. Restableciendo logros no ganados. \u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo restablecer mi contrase\u00f1a? (Si no la recuerdo) link Justo aqu\u00ed: https://retroachievements.org/resetPassword.php En el sitio, p\u00e1gina principal, mientras no est\u00e9 conectado: \u00bfPorque no puedo ver mi nueva foto de perfil? link Presiona Ctrl + F5 (en la mayor\u00eda de navegadores). Algunas veces despu\u00e9s de haber cambiado tu foto de perfil (tambi\u00e9n conocido como avatar o foto de usuario) necesitas refrescar la cache de tu navegador; en la mayor\u00eda de los navegadores la manera mas r\u00e1pida de hacerlo es con Ctrl + F5 . \u00bfVoy obtener alg\u00fan privilegio si me convierto en Patreon? link En el sitio web vas a obtener un badge que dice \"I helped fund RA!\". En el servidor de discord vas a tener acceso a un canal dedicado. Aunque estamos inmensamente agradecido por los aportes de nuestros Patreons , no hay otro bonus aparte de esos. Gracias a las contribuciones de Patreon el proyecto de RetroAchievements puede pagar un servidor decente en el sitio web, correr el bot de discord y tambi\u00e9n realizar respaldos cada cierto tiempo (para recuperar informaci\u00f3n en caso de un desastre), y todo esto con una experiencia libre de anuncios. La comunidad entera le merece un gran gracias a los patreons. \u00bfRetroAchievements esta haciendo dinero por medio de la emulaci\u00f3n? link No. RetroAchievements es una comunidad de fans devotos que quieren rendirle homenaje a sus juegos favoritos creando y sacando logros! Aunque tambi\u00e9n aceptamos donaciones por medio de Patreon todo el dinero donado se utiliza para pagar los gastos de los servidores y mantener el sitio completamente libre de anuncios. Todos los programadores y desarrolladores entregan su tiempo a lo mejor para la comunidad a su propio costo.

(If I don't remember my password) Will I have any privilege if I become a patron? Is RetroAchievements profiting off of emulation? I was using the site and it crashed (403 error), what happened? What is RetroAchievements.org? link RetroAchievements.org is a zero profit community who collaborate and compete to earn custom-made achievements in classic games through emulation. Achievements are made by and for the community. We provide various custom-built emulators for you to use which will detect when you have completed various challenges. Once logged in, the emulators will post the achievements you've completed back to the site, so you can check and compare your progress to your friends. Here's an example of RAGens, playing Streets of Rage 2. You will see two leaderboard attempt counters (bottom-right), one achievement popping and finally the Achievement Overlay (press ESC ): What is HARDCORE mode? link HARDCORE mode is an additional feature to separate out the good gamers from the great gamers: HARDCORE mode disables all savestate ability in the emulator: you would not be able to save and reload at any time. You would have to complete the game and get the achievements first time, just like it were on the original console. In reward for this, you will earn both the standard and the HARDCORE achievement, in effect earning double points! A regular game worth 400 points, is now worth 800 if you complete it fully on HARDCORE! For example: if you complete the game fully for 400 points, you then have the opportunity to earn another 400 on HARDCORE. Note : If you want to play with the HARDCORE mode disabled (also known as \"softcore\"), expect to have some issues. Read in this link Why you shouldn't use the load state feature . Which emulator do I need to use? link The official RetroAchievements.org emulators are all Windows-based. For other operating systems you can use RetroArch. More information below: Official RetroAchievements.org emulators link Please download the emulator of your choice from the download page , log in using your username and password (yeah, you need to create an account first), then load a ROM and play! What is the Achievement Overlay and how do I access it? link The Achievement Overlay is a built-in RetroAchievements screen that shows the achievements you can earn and their descriptions of what is required, which achievements you have earned, your achievement score, details on high score leaderboard scores, and more. Normally, to access it, this will be set up on ESC keyboard key, or the pause function in the game. In most emulators, a game must be active for it to be functional. Some of the emulators should already be setup assigning a controller button to view the achievement overlay. Generally ESC on the keyboard should activate it, but if you want to assign it to a controller, here are some tricks for some of the official emulators: For RAVBA, go to Tools \u21d2 Key Shortcuts \u21d2 Emulation, select \"Pause\", set \"shortcut key\" to a button and click \"Assign\" For RASNES, go to Input \u21d2 Customize Hotkeys and change Pause/Overlay on page 1. For RANES, Config \u21d2 Map Hotkeys and change Pause to a button ( Note : this can crash the emulator, do it without a rom loaded for better chances). RetroArch emulators link For non-Windows operating systems you need to use RetroArch . Currently you can earn achievements via RetroArch on the following platforms: Windows Linux Mac Android (yes! you can earn achievements on-the-go with your Android phone!) PlayStation Vita (needs to be hacked with HENkaku ) PlayStation 3 Playstation 4 Wii U Nintendo 3DS Nintendo Switch Raspberry Pi (recommended systems: RetroPie , lakka and RecalBox ) Full list of Retroarch supported platforms is in this link. You can get RetroArch on the following links: stable nightly Once you installed and did the initial configuration, follow this guide to setup Achievements: https://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/ Which RetroArch core should I use? link Keep in mind that not every RetroArch core is compatible with RetroAchievements. Check this list to see which one to choose . How can I see the badge when I earn an achievement on RetroArch? link This feature was implemented in RetroArch 1.7.7 (May/2019), however there are some platforms where it still doesn't work. You just need to assure the Menu Widget option enabled (and it's usually enabled by default). What are the white points? link White points, known as Retro Ratio points, are secondary points based on how hard an achievement is, however this feature is not very accurate currently . Explained here in detail . My welcome email has gone missing! link Unfortunately sometimes the welcome email has been known to go missing. If this happens, please log in with your username/password you registered with, then visit your settings page. At the top you'll find the option to resend your registration email. Why can't I see my new profile picture? link Press Ctrl + F5 (on most browsers). Sometimes after you've changed your profile picture (also known as avatar or user pic) and you need to refresh your browser cache; in most browsers Ctrl + F5 is the quickest way to do it. Where can I find ROMs? link Not here. It is illegal to host or distribute copyrighted ROMs. However we have a page about Free Games where you can find some really cool homebrews. Why is my game not loading up achievements? link Either: It doesn't have achievements. You have the incorrect rom. A good practice is to check the official game's forum topic. If you still don't have an answer check this page here for more details: My game is not loading achievements . Why do I get a message that some achievements are unsupported? link This message informs the user that some achievements cannot be activated either because their version of RetroArch and/or the core being used does not support some newer logic features, or because required areas of the RAM are not exposed for achievement processing. In most cases updating to the lastest version of RetroArch will correct the problem, alternately updating or using a different supported core will resolve the problem. RetroArch/RALibretro doesn't launch my arcade game. What should I do? link First things first : be sure you're using the correct RetroArch core. Check here which core you should use to get the RetroAchievements feature for arcade games . Second thing : Arcade ROMs are more complicated than console ROMs. There are a few concepts and terminology you need to understand and then it will start to make sense. Here is a good text on this matter: Demystifying MAME ROMs . Pro tip : use your favorite websearch engine and look for a \"reference set\" (using ROMs randomly obtained from different sources is a \"trial and error\" method and will most likely lead you to a lot of frustration). Will RetroAchievements support this or that console? link Short answer: Yes, it will. Long answer: The only correct answer to this question is \"Whenever someone with the skills and desire to code support, does just that.\" - Everyone here is a volunteer so additional support and features happen when they happen. In many cases support for a console is dictated by the emulator(core) developer and is outside of Retroachievement's control. For more information on specific consoles you can check here: System X When? How do I request an achievement set? link On each game's page there is a link to \"Request Set\". Clicking this will add your name to the list of users who have requested a set for the game. Clicking again will withdraw the request. To see other users who have requested the set, click on the \"Set Requestors for this game\" link in the \"More Info\" section at bottom of the game page. The total number of requests are tallied and displayed on the Most Requested Sets page which can also be sorted by console. If and when a set is created the user request will be automatically returned to use for another game. The number of requests available to a user is determined as follows: 1 for every year you've had your account 1 for reaching 2500, 5k, 10k, 15k, 20k 1 for every 10k from 20k-180k 1 for every 20k thereafter Note : All achievement developers are volunteers, requesting a set gives no guarantee that achievements will be made. The purpose of the request feature is to give developers visibility to what players want most. You might also consider making achievement suggestions on a game's forum page to help get a set off the ground. What do I do when the achievement isn't working right? link When problems with achievements occur, either where the achievement wasn't awarded to you or it was awarded at the wrong time, there are solutions to get the problems fixed and for proper credit to be given to you! First you'll want to report the broken achievement . (This is an excellent way to contribute to the betterment of the community!) It creates a ticket report for the achievement developers who will then review the problem and look for a solution. If the achievement wasn't awarded, you can request a manual-unlock . You'll need to report the broken achievement and provide proof of completion . How do I report a broken achievement? link There are two ways to report broken achievements. In the emulator title bar go to RetroAchievements \u21d2 Report Broken Achievements : For Official RetroAchevement emulators only: . For RetroArch users you can submit the report directly via website. On every achievement's page you'll see a link saying Report an issue for this achievement , like in the image below: If you use the Official RetroAchevement emulators you can also report problems from the website achievement page, but it is preferred that you use the method built into the emulators. What details I have to add to a broken achievement report? link You have to add those information in order for a developer to recognise an issue: Type of issue (doesn't trigger or triggers at the wrong time) Emulator you were using (and core if using RALib/Retroarch) RA hash (checksum) to recognise a version of the game What details should I add to a broken achievement report? link If possible, in the broken achievement report Comment paste a link to a screenshot or video (even better) of where the problem occurred. It's recommended to post screenshots on imgur and videos on YouTube . Also add details like: when it was/wasn't awarded; what game mode (HARDCORE/softcore); what difficulty level or other settings you've selected; how long you were playing; when you most recently died or continued; what you think the problem might be or any details you think could be helpful. This is necessary so the achievement developers know where the problem is. What is an RA hash? link RA hash is an unique string of 32 hexadecimal numbers, to distinguish different games and versions of them, all of them have one. How do I check the RA hash of the game I'm playing? link For Retroarch - Quick Menu \u21d2 Information, then at the bottom there is \"RetroAchievements Hash\" which is, in fact an RA hash For Standalones/RaLibretro - RetroAchievement tab at the top \u21d2 Get ROM Checksum, and it shows the RA hash How can I get credit for an achievement I earned but wasn't awarded? link In short how to request a manual unlock link If you use Discord Post in the #manual-unlock channel a request that looks similar to one of these: @manual-unlock http://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php?i=9577 HARDCORE Proof: https://youtu.be/uqD-GTkZbLo @manual-unlock http://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php?i=16705 softcore Proof: https://i.imgur.com/83bJE43.png If you don't use Discord While signed into RetroAchievments.org send a private message to the RAdmin user with the title: Manual Unlock Request and a description that looks similar to this: Hi. I'm requesting a manual unlock. http://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php?i=9577 HARDCORE Proof: https://youtu.be/uqD-GTkZbLo In detail how to request a manual unlock link Open a ticket describing with details the problem you had with the achievement. ( How do I report a broken achievement? ) If the achievement wasn't registered on the site due to a network problem, you don't need to open a ticket. Get a proof/evidence that you completed the achievement. Acceptable proofs : Screenshots that show that one is playing in HARDCORE and have completed the achievement. Video of such (even better) ( perfect example of ideal proof provided by gr1nya ). Examples of achievements you've earned that prove you've earned this achievement. Example: You got the achievement for 10k points but the one for 5k points wasn't awarded to you. If you're on our discord server, send a message on the #manual-unlock channel tagging the @manual-unlock role; if you're not on Discord, send a private message message to the RAdmin user. Your message must have: The link to the ticket url. You can find the ticket here: http://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php What mode you were playing (HARDCORE/softcore) Link to your qualified proof of completion. Include proof that the achievement was earned in HARDCORE, if you were playing in HARDCORE. Previous request examples: https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/453242743292952578/803985066300145715 https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/692553884320923759/782277827512762368 https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/310195854642249728/713399944618180629 Note: Manual unlocks are intended for players with proof of earning achievements that did not trigger on site due to a bug or network issue. They are not indented for, and will not be awarded to players who have played the game prior to a set being available, or on an another inherently unsupported platform (original hardware for example). What if I got an achievement I didn't earn? link Same with not getting it when you should in most cases you'll want to create a ticket report , leaving an explanation of what went wrong. You'll also want to reset these achievements from your earn history so you can get the satisfaction of truly earning them. How do I reset achievements? link There are three ways to do this: On the achievement page: On the game page (when you want or need to reset all earns in a game): Near the bottom of your user settings page: Am I the only one with an issue? link If an achievement doesn't work correctly for you, there is a very good chance it doesn't work for other people. You can check in the achievement's page and look for where it says 'The achievement has 'X' open tickets': If the game has tickets, click on the 'open tickets' link. There will be a list to show any reports of broken achievements. You can comment on these to add helpful details or say you have a problem with this achievement too. What's considered cheating (for HARDCORE)? What if I find evidence of a cheater? link Users are required to earn their achievements fairly and legitimately. In general, a player must unlock achievements: using the latest release version of an approved supported emulator; inside of a game by in-game actions; by their own control; without outside-modifying game files or game code; without using another player\u2019s save file, and; without using outside cheat programs. If this is not clear enough and you need an in-depth ruleset to understand what is cheating, check the Global Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules . We live by an honor code most of all. If you find an evidence of a cheater, send the evidence to RAdmin or email to RAmodmail@gmail.com . I want to make achievements! link Good to hear! The best place to start is here: Getting Started as an Achievement Developer . Once you're familiar with the Memory Inspector and the other Achievements related dialogs, you can go to other Developer Docs . Please don't hesitate to ask if you need help, don't struggle! The most important thing is to make sure you're enjoying whatever it is you're doing. If you're not having fun, don't do it. But if you get frustrated and want to persist, just drop a message on the forums or in Discord server and someone will get back to you shortly. How do I reset my password? (If I don't remember my password) link Right Here: https://retroachievements.org/resetPassword.php On Site, front page, while not logged in: Will I have any privilege if I become a patron? link On the website you'll have a badge to mean \"I helped fund RA!\". On the discord server you'll have access to a dedicated channel. Although we are all immensely grateful for the contributions of the patrons , there is no other bonus besides those ones. Thanks to the Patreon contributions the RetroAchievements project can pay for a decent server to run the website, run the discord bot and also have periodic backups (to recover data in the event of a disaster), and all this with an ad-free experience. The whole community owe a big thank you to the patrons. Is RetroAchievements profiting off of emulation? link No. RetroAchievements is a community of devoted fans who want to pay tribute to their favorite games by creating and playing achievements! While we do accept donations through Patreon all of the money donated is given to fund server expenses and keeping the website completely ad-free. All programmers, achievement creators and staff members give their time the betterment of the community at their own expense. I was using the site and it crashed (403 error), what happened? link It happened because you typed one of following words on the site: select union update delete insert table from ascii hex unhex drop and also some special characters like \"%\" will cause it This is because the site lacks a proper framework, so in order to make the database safe the protection was added, removing ability to type those words. This issue is temporary and will be resolved when the site gets a proper framework later at some point. The best work around is to copy the text into clipboard before posting it, to ensure that you won't lose anything if it breaks.

First, systems where the entire game file is hashed are listed, and later systems where the RA hash may differ from the file MD5. Systems that Hash the Entire File link Apple II link NOTE : As saving and other manipulations can mutate disk data, local copies of loaded images are required to ensure that their hashes do not change across sessions. Atari 2600 link Atari Jaguar link ColecoVision link GameBoy link GameBoy Color link GameBoy Advance link GameGear link MSX link NOTE : As saving mutates disk data, local copies of loaded images are required to ensure that their hashes do not change across sessions. We do not believe this is working, but have yet to find a game where saving to disk actually works. N64 link NOTE : This may result in three unique hashes for each game. The z64 extension is big endian (ABCD). The n64 extension is little endian (DCBA). And the v64 extension is middle endian (BADC). NeoGeo Pocket [Color] link PC-8001 / PC-8801 link NOTE : As saving and other manipulations can mutate disk data, local copies of loaded images are required to ensure that their hashes do not change across sessions. Pokemon Mini link Sega 32X link Sega Master System link Sega MegaDrive (Genesis) link TIC-80 link Vectrex link VirtualBoy link Watara Supervision link WonderSwan [Color] link Systems that Hash a Portion of the File link 3DO link The volume header (first 132 bytes of sector 0) and the contents of the LaunchMe file are hashed. Arcade link The filename string without the extension (path/galaga.zip -> galaga) is hashed. It is case-sensitive. Atari 7800 link If the ROM starts with \\1ATARI7800 , the first 128 bytes are ignored and the remaining file contents are hashed. If the ROM does not start with \\1ATARI7800 , the entire file is hashed. Atari Lynx link If the ROM starts with LYNX\\0 , the first 64 bytes are ignored and the remaining file contents are hashed. If the ROM does not start with LYNX\\0 , the entire file is hashed. Famicom Disk System link If the ROM starts with FDS\\1a , the first 16 bytes are ignored and the remaining file contents are hashed. If the ROM does not start with FDS\\1a , the entire file is hashed. NOTE : As saving mutates disk data, local copies of loaded images are required to ensure that their hashes do not change across sessions. NES link If the ROM starts with NES\\1a , the first 16 bytes are ignored and the remaining file contents are hashed. If the ROM does not start with NES\\1a , the entire file is hashed. Nintendo DS link An NDS ROM has a 0x160 byte header. In this header are pointers to icon/title information and to the boot code for both processors. The hash method combines the header, the two pieces of boot code, and the icon/title information and hashes the result. The icon/title information is 0xA00 bytes starting at the address stored in the header at $68 The arm9 code address is stored at $20 in the header, and the size is stored at $2C in the header The arm7 code address is stored at $30 in the header, and the size is stored at $3C in the header PCEngine (TurboGrafx16) link If the size of the file is 512 bytes more than a multiple of 128KB, the first 512 bytes are ignored and the remaining file contents are hashed. If the size of the file is not 512 bytes more than a multiple of 128KB, the entire file is hashed. PC Engine CD link The boot code and disc title are hashed as follows: * Read 128 bytes from sector 1 of the data track (PCE predates ISO-9660, so there's no file system to read). * If \"PC Engine CD-ROM SYSTEM\" does not exist at 32 bytes into the data, discard as invalid. * Copy the last 22 bytes of the data into a buffer. This is the disc title, and usually identifies the game. * The first three bytes of the data are a little-endian sector index for the boot code. * The fourth byte is the number of sectors that the boot code occupies. * The boot code is appended to the buffer (N sectors, starting at sector X) * The buffer is hashed. PC-FX link The boot code and disc title are hashed as follows: * Read 32 bytes from sector 0 of the data track (PC-FX predates ISO-9660, so there's no file system to read). * If \"PC-FX:Hu_CD-ROM\" was not read, discard as invalid. * Read 128 bytes from sector 1 of the data track into a buffer. This is the volume header and includes the disc title. * The 32-bit value at 32-bytes into the buffer is the first sector of the boot code. * The 32-bit value at 36-bytes into the buffer is the number of sectors that the boot code occupies. * The boot code is appended to the buffer (N sectors, starting at sector X) * The buffer is hashed. PlayStation link The primary executable and its name are hashed as follows: * The SYSTEM.CNF file is loaded and parsed. The primary executable is identified by the BOOT= line within. * The primary executable name (and its path) are extracted from SYSTEM.CNF and written to a buffer. * The contents of the primary executable are appended to the buffer. * The buffer is hashed. PlayStation 2 link The primary executable and its name are hashed as follows: * The SYSTEM.CNF file is loaded and parsed. The primary executable is identified by the BOOT2= line within. * The primary executable name (and its path) are extracted from SYSTEM.CNF and written to a buffer. * The contents of the primary executable are appended to the buffer. * The buffer is hashed. Sega CD / Sega Saturn link The first 512 bytes of track 0 are hashed. This contains the volume header and ROM header. The first 16 bytes must be \"SEGADISCSYSTEM \" for Sega CD or \"SEGA SEGASATURN \" for Sega Saturn. If not, discard as invalid. Immediately following those 512 bytes are an arbitrary amount of code that validates the region and loads the primary executable. Without processing the code, we cannot determine what additional file(s) to hash, so this was determined to be sufficient as an alternative to hashing the entire CD. SNES link If the size of the file is 512 bytes more than a multiple of 8KB, the first 512 bytes are ignored and the remaining file contents are hashed. If the size of the file is not 512 bytes more than a multiple of 8KB, the entire file is hashed.

Conceptos Basicos link Tecnicamente un logro es un grupo de condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas en un punto particular en un video juego . Cuando abres un juego en un emulador con las funciones de RetroAchievements, el emulador esta siempre checando si esas condiciones se cumplen en el punto exacto. Cuando todas las condiciones de un logro en particular son cumplidas, se dispara el logro y el emulador deja de checar las condiciones para ese logro. El proceso de creaci\u00f3n de un logro basicamente se divide en 3 pasos: Encontar un lugar en la Memoria RAM del juego donde se almacene la informacion que buscas (ejemplos: nivel, barra de vida, tiempo, monedas, sacar un arma, obtener un item, etc.). Crear las condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas para que se dispare el logro. Probar si tu logro funciona como es debido. La mayoria de las veces vaz a tener que volver al punto 2 y 3 muchisimas veces para refinar la logica de tu logro. En este documento vamos a ver como lograr los pasos de arriba. Una vez que estes seguro que tu logro esta saltando con las condiciones que tu quieres, puedes subirlo al servidor. Vamos a ver mas sobre eso en un momento. Primeros Pasos link Antes que nada necesitas estar seguro que tienes un emulador de RA de la pagina de descargas de RetroAchievements y tambien haberte creado una cuenta para poder iniciar seccion en el emulador. En esta guia vamos a utilizar RAGens como demostracion, y el juego Sonic the Hedgehog . Estamos utilizando RAGens pero lo mismo aplica para cualquier otro emulador. Para empezar abre el ejecutable de RAGens, e inicia seccion cuando salga la venta de inicio. Siguiente, ve a File -> Open y selecciona el ROM del que quieres trabajar los logros. Inspector de Memoria link Ahora deberias tener en tu ventana principal corriendo Sonic. Hay otras 3 ventanas que vamos a estar utilizando, que se pueden encontrar sobre la pesta\u00f1a de RetroAchievements en el menu. Vamos a trabajar con el Inspector de Memoria primero: El inspector de memoria se puede utilizar para encontrar variables en la RAM que podamos utilizar. Esencialmente estas en una caseria de tesoros por encontrar los lugares en memoria - esta ventana te ayudara a examinar y filtrar la RAM del juego que se encuentra corriendo. NOTA: Si deseas un video paso por paso explicando como encontra valores en la memoria, este viejo video puede llegar a ser util . Tambien mira : Un vistaso al Inspector de Memoria y Tips en la busqueda de Memoria . Para empezar o reiniciar una prueba, haz click en New 8-bit Test en la parte casi superior del medio. Para manter las cosas simple, vamos a empezar a buscar el valor en memoria que guarda el numero de anillos que hemos recolectado. Nuestros pasos son los siguientes: Carga el ROM y empieza una nueva partida. Resetea la ventana de memoria: Haz click en New 8-bit Test . Regresa al juego y cambia el numero de anillos en la memoria. Por ejemplo, colecciona un anillo En la ventana de memoria, ahora vamos a filtrar los valores que son 'mas grandes que los antiguos valores' (simbolo > ). Seleccionamos esto y, entonces hacemos click en Filter . Cuando ya estes haciendo esto por una 3ra y 4ta vez, el numero de posibilidades o 'candidatos' va a ir disminuyendo. Vamos a seguir haciendo esto asta que lleguemos a un numero muy peque\u00f1o (el mas peque\u00f1o que sea posible), puede llegar a tomar entre 4-5 intentos. Ahora podemos hacer click en la ventana de resultados, y monitoriar los valores en memoria, hasta abajo en el visor de memoria. Continua en el juego y deberias de ver como los valores en la memoria cambian cada vez que coleccionas anillos. Si no es asi, o si algo no se ve bien, intenta otro valor. Con el primer Sonic the Hedgehog, el valor en memoria para el numero de anillos deberia de ser 0xfe20 . Nota 1 : Utilizando estados de guardados (save states)(F5 para salvar un estado, F8 para cargar un estado, F6-F7 para cambiar que estados utilizar), puedes brincar entre estados de guardado permitiendo esto alterar la RAM, y utilizarlo para filtrar malos candidatos. Puedes buscar resultados que permanescan iguales (Es decir si es que sabes que un valor no tuvo que haber cambiado, utiliza = ), o para valores que son diferentes (utiliza 'no igual', simbolo != ). Nota 2 : Afortunadamente no hay una garantia de un juego a otro para saber como los desarrolladores almacenaban la informacion (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, decimales con codigo binario, negativo/invertido. Por ejemplo utilizando 0xff/0xffff para representar 'fijo', o algo completamente aleatorio), pero eventualmente deberias de encontrarte con varios buenos valores. Nota si estas batallando en encontrar buenos valores, postea en el Foro de Ayuda de RetroAchievements.org , o en el Servidor de Discord de RetroAchievements . Hay bastante gente que estaria dispuesta en ayudarte con mucho gusto!! Tip : Si te gusta experimentar con la memoria, intenta ingresar valores directamente en el visor de la RAM. Esto puede causar efectos devastadores en un juego, o podria hacer exactamente lo que deseas que pase, (o inclusive nada!) De todos modos podria ser util, ver si ingresas un valor y paso el resultado que esperas. Utilizalo con cuidado! Cuando encuentres un valor del que te sientes feliz con el, puedes escriber una peque\u00f1a nota de lo que es haciendo click en Save Note , esto lo va a guardar en la base de datos, y va a ser automaticamente cargado la siguiente vez que cargues el visor de memoria para ese juego, donde sea que te encuentres! Nota despues que haces click en 'Save Note', la nota va a ser automaticamente guardada en la base de datos y compartida, la cual todos los desarrolladores tendran acceso a ella. Todos van a descargar esa nota cuando carguen su ROM. Si intentas sobre-escribir una nota, te va a salir una ventana de confirmacion antes de guardarla. Puedes encontrar mas utiles Tips en Busqueda de Memoria aqui . Sets de Logros link Ok asi que el valor en memoria para el numero de anillos se encuentra almacenado en 0xfe20 - nota para un no-programador, estamos manejando numeros en el sistema numerico Hexadecimal que puede llegar a ser desalentador, pero no te preocupes, esencialmente simplemente son numeros y letras en vez de solo numeros, y no olvides 0x al principio para mostrar que es un valor en memoria en hexadecimal. Hemos encontrado un valor en el que estamos interesado y lo hemos guardado con Save Note . Ahora queremos crear un nuevo logro. Ve a la pesta\u00f1a de RetroAchievements en el menu de tu emulador, escoje Achievement Sets y vas a ver esta ventana: Aqui agrupamos todos los logros disponibles en tres sets: Logros Core (los principales, set publico de logros), Unofficial/User Achievements (publicos, pero no otorgan puntos: para revision), Local Achievements (personales, en tu PC). En la venta de Logros, haz click en Local Achievements (superior izquierda), luego en Add New Achievement (superior derecha). Esto va a\u00f1adir una entrada vacia en la lista del centro. Haz doble click en ella: si aun no esta abierta, esto deberia de abrir la ventana del Achievement Editor (editor de logros). Editor de Logros link A si es como se ve: Esta es la ventana final en la que vamos a poner toda la informacion junta. La mayoria de los campos de arriba se explican solos, ejemplo: Titulo, Descripcion, Puntos. La principal seria la parte de 'Requisitos' Vamos a decir que queremos agregar un logro por coleccionar cierto numero de anillos. Vamos a decir 15 por simplicidad. Despues de llenar los campos de arriba y a ver seleccionado un icono apropiado (en este ejemplo estamos utilizando la medalla del trofeo dorado (00136), pero tu puedes subir una nueva), ocupamos llenar los requisitos. Tenemos un requisito, ese numero de anillos tiene que ser minimo 15 . El siguiente click seria en Add New Requirement . Clickear este boton va a agregar algunos valores por default a la lista de requisitos. Los valores por defaults simplemente se percatan que algo relativamente sensible se agrego a la lista. Por ahora, ignorando el campo 'Special?'. Cuando clickeamos en crear, el valor default en memoria va a ser el ultimo valor que dejaste en la ventana de memoria. Lo siguiente seria cambiar estos valores a los siguientes: Size : 16-bit Memory : 0xfe20 Cmp : >= - esta es la comparacion que vamos a hacer. Podemos tener cualquier comparacion aqui, pero es sencible que tengas un \"mayor que e igual a\". Esto es importante porque si tenemos 10 anillos y despues obtenemos 10 anillos de una caja de 10 anillos vamos a tener 20, y vamos a perder el logro ya que tendriamos que tener exactamente 15 anillos. Type : Value - estamos comparando este valor en memoria con un valor fijo: 15 Size : Empty - Esto es solamente relevante cuando estemos comparando valor en memoria con otro valor en memoria Mem/Val : 15 - el numero de anillos requirido: el valor del que estamos comparando la memoria Hit Count : 0 - ignora esto por ahora, es util cuando necesitas que algo paso un cierto numero de veces Con esto establecido, no necesitamos ninguna otra condicion que agregar, asi que podemos regresar a Achievements Dialog (Ventana de Logros). Para estar seguros, tenemos que guardar nuestro progreso presionando Save Local ! Esto guarda todo localmente para asegurar que no perdamos ningun progreso. Nota : usualmente un logro tiene mas de un requisito para evadir que salte en un momento equivocado (por ejemplo: jugando en modo demo). En este ejemplo estamos utilizando solamente un requisito para simplificar la explicacion. Mira mas Tips en la Creacion de Logros aqui . Probando el logro link Ahora podemos 'activar' este logro localmente presionando en Activate a mano derecha de la ventana. Esto va a empezar a monitoriar estos valores en memoria y va a entregar el logro una vez que todas las condiciones se hubieran cumplido de manera verdadera. Ahora podemos avanzar y probar si este logro sirve! Si presionamos Esc mientras jugamos, vas a ver como se miraria el logro desde la interfaz de RetroAchievements! A pesar de que el logro funciono bien en nuestras pruebas, un logro con una logica como esa no esta listo para ser oficialmente lanzado. Primero que nada: tiene una sola condicion: \"anillos coleccionados >= 15\". El problema es que ese mismo valor es el mismo que se utiliza para almacenar el numero de anillos cuando el juego corre en \"modo demo\" (Cuando la computadora juega el juego automaticamente cuando duras mucho tiempo en la pantalla de titulo). A si que, si Sonic colecciona 15 anillos en modo demo el logro tambien saldria, que es algo que no queremos. Checa los tips en la siguiente seccion de abajo para conocer como mejorar la logica de tu logro y hacerlo aceptable para que sea oficialmente lanzado. Tips Importantes link Aqui estan algunos tips que tienes que tener en mente cuando te encuentres creando logros: Nunca Evade hacer logros con una sola condicion lo mas que puedas . De otra manera es muy probable que el logro se dispare en una parte no deseada. Este es el error mas comun por un desarrollador Si el juego tiene un modo demo (El CPU juega despues que esperas un tiempo en la pantalla de titulo), percatate de encontrar el valor para eso y agrega una condicion para que tus logros no se disparen en modo demo. Tambien necesitas saber como utilizar PauseIf y ResetIf . PauseIf cheat codes : Si el juego tiene un cheat para aumentar vidas, seleccionar niveles, etc. Percatate de encontrar el valor para eso y agregar algo de proteccion en tus logros. OK, talvez no es un tema muy sencillo, pero es algo que tienes que tener en cuenta cuando estes creando un set oficial de logros. Evita crear logros de simplemente llegar a un nivel. Esto puede ser conseguido por medio de un password o un cheat. Mejor haz logros por terminar un nivel, como en la plantilla de aqui . Tambie, no hagas logros por simplemente empezar un juego o \"empieza el juego con X personaje\" . Si quieres crear un logro por conseguir un item especifico y unico, agrega algunas condiciones para estar seguro que el jugador obtuvo el item donde se suponia que se tenga que obtener, como en esta plantilla de aqui . De otra manera el logro podra ser conseguible utilizando un codigo o cargando una partida de cargado. Evita hacer muchos logros sobre simples cosas que necesitan casi cero esfuerzo . Ejemplos de que NO tienes que hacer: obten una moneda o un hongo en Super Mario Bros. Ten encuenta los conceptos no-bienvenidos en el dise\u00f1o de logros . Se creativo con tus logros . Esos que abarcan caracteristicas y detalles unicos son los mas bienvenidos. Los jugadores aman cuando un peque\u00f1o detalle de un juego que aman es apoyado por un logro. Leer un Walkthrough en GameFAQs te puede dar un poco de inspiracion tambien. Intentar pasar la mayor cantidad de tiempo posible con el juego, especialmente si es la primera vez que desarrollas logros. Toma mas tiempo conocer el juego por dentro, trabajar con la memoria funciona ya que es la mejor fuente de ideas para logros unicos. Puedes encontrar mas en la pagina de Tips y Trucos . Siguientes pasos link Ahora que ya sabes como utilizar el Inspector de Memoria, y el Editor de Logros. Llego la hora de que aprendas nuevas tecnicas y practiques: En orden que refines la logica de tus logros, puedes ver con que funciones cuentas en la pagina de Funciones en la Logica de los Logros . Puedes aprender viendo logros existentes que otros desarrolladores han hecho con una explicacion extra en la pagina de Ejemplos Reales . Tambien puedes ver algunos ejemplos genericos en la pagina de Plantillas para Logros . Una vez que hubieras aprendido todas las tecnicas basicas, si quieres obtener el estatus de Desarrollador tienes que seguir los pasos explicados aqui: Como convertirme en un desarrollador de logros .

Cuando abres un juego en un emulador con las funciones de RetroAchievements, el emulador esta siempre checando si esas condiciones se cumplen en el punto exacto. Cuando todas las condiciones de un logro en particular son cumplidas, se dispara el logro y el emulador deja de checar las condiciones para ese logro. El proceso de creaci\u00f3n de un logro basicamente se divide en 3 pasos: Encontar un lugar en la Memoria RAM del juego donde se almacene la informacion que buscas (ejemplos: nivel, barra de vida, tiempo, monedas, sacar un arma, obtener un item, etc.). Crear las condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas para que se dispare el logro. Probar si tu logro funciona como es debido. La mayoria de las veces vaz a tener que volver al punto 2 y 3 muchisimas veces para refinar la logica de tu logro. En este documento vamos a ver como lograr los pasos de arriba. Una vez que estes seguro que tu logro esta saltando con las condiciones que tu quieres, puedes subirlo al servidor. Vamos a ver mas sobre eso en un momento.","title":"Conceptos Basicos"},{"location":"Getting-Started-as-an-Achievement-Developer-es/#primeros-pasos","text":"Antes que nada necesitas estar seguro que tienes un emulador de RA de la pagina de descargas de RetroAchievements y tambien haberte creado una cuenta para poder iniciar seccion en el emulador. En esta guia vamos a utilizar RAGens como demostracion, y el juego Sonic the Hedgehog . Estamos utilizando RAGens pero lo mismo aplica para cualquier otro emulador. Para empezar abre el ejecutable de RAGens, e inicia seccion cuando salga la venta de inicio. Siguiente, ve a File -> Open y selecciona el ROM del que quieres trabajar los logros.","title":"Primeros Pasos"},{"location":"Getting-Started-as-an-Achievement-Developer-es/#inspector-de-memoria","text":"Ahora deberias tener en tu ventana principal corriendo Sonic. Hay otras 3 ventanas que vamos a estar utilizando, que se pueden encontrar sobre la pesta\u00f1a de RetroAchievements en el menu. Vamos a trabajar con el Inspector de Memoria primero: El inspector de memoria se puede utilizar para encontrar variables en la RAM que podamos utilizar. Esencialmente estas en una caseria de tesoros por encontrar los lugares en memoria - esta ventana te ayudara a examinar y filtrar la RAM del juego que se encuentra corriendo. NOTA: Si deseas un video paso por paso explicando como encontra valores en la memoria, este viejo video puede llegar a ser util . Tambien mira : Un vistaso al Inspector de Memoria y Tips en la busqueda de Memoria . Para empezar o reiniciar una prueba, haz click en New 8-bit Test en la parte casi superior del medio. Para manter las cosas simple, vamos a empezar a buscar el valor en memoria que guarda el numero de anillos que hemos recolectado. Nuestros pasos son los siguientes: Carga el ROM y empieza una nueva partida. Resetea la ventana de memoria: Haz click en New 8-bit Test . Regresa al juego y cambia el numero de anillos en la memoria. Por ejemplo, colecciona un anillo En la ventana de memoria, ahora vamos a filtrar los valores que son 'mas grandes que los antiguos valores' (simbolo > ). Seleccionamos esto y, entonces hacemos click en Filter . Cuando ya estes haciendo esto por una 3ra y 4ta vez, el numero de posibilidades o 'candidatos' va a ir disminuyendo. Vamos a seguir haciendo esto asta que lleguemos a un numero muy peque\u00f1o (el mas peque\u00f1o que sea posible), puede llegar a tomar entre 4-5 intentos. Ahora podemos hacer click en la ventana de resultados, y monitoriar los valores en memoria, hasta abajo en el visor de memoria. Continua en el juego y deberias de ver como los valores en la memoria cambian cada vez que coleccionas anillos. Si no es asi, o si algo no se ve bien, intenta otro valor. Con el primer Sonic the Hedgehog, el valor en memoria para el numero de anillos deberia de ser 0xfe20 . Nota 1 : Utilizando estados de guardados (save states)(F5 para salvar un estado, F8 para cargar un estado, F6-F7 para cambiar que estados utilizar), puedes brincar entre estados de guardado permitiendo esto alterar la RAM, y utilizarlo para filtrar malos candidatos. Puedes buscar resultados que permanescan iguales (Es decir si es que sabes que un valor no tuvo que haber cambiado, utiliza = ), o para valores que son diferentes (utiliza 'no igual', simbolo != ). Nota 2 : Afortunadamente no hay una garantia de un juego a otro para saber como los desarrolladores almacenaban la informacion (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, decimales con codigo binario, negativo/invertido. Por ejemplo utilizando 0xff/0xffff para representar 'fijo', o algo completamente aleatorio), pero eventualmente deberias de encontrarte con varios buenos valores. Nota si estas batallando en encontrar buenos valores, postea en el Foro de Ayuda de RetroAchievements.org , o en el Servidor de Discord de RetroAchievements . Hay bastante gente que estaria dispuesta en ayudarte con mucho gusto!! Tip : Si te gusta experimentar con la memoria, intenta ingresar valores directamente en el visor de la RAM. Esto puede causar efectos devastadores en un juego, o podria hacer exactamente lo que deseas que pase, (o inclusive nada!) De todos modos podria ser util, ver si ingresas un valor y paso el resultado que esperas. Utilizalo con cuidado! Cuando encuentres un valor del que te sientes feliz con el, puedes escriber una peque\u00f1a nota de lo que es haciendo click en Save Note , esto lo va a guardar en la base de datos, y va a ser automaticamente cargado la siguiente vez que cargues el visor de memoria para ese juego, donde sea que te encuentres! Nota despues que haces click en 'Save Note', la nota va a ser automaticamente guardada en la base de datos y compartida, la cual todos los desarrolladores tendran acceso a ella. Todos van a descargar esa nota cuando carguen su ROM. Si intentas sobre-escribir una nota, te va a salir una ventana de confirmacion antes de guardarla.

Hemos encontrado un valor en el que estamos interesado y lo hemos guardado con Save Note . Ahora queremos crear un nuevo logro. Ve a la pesta\u00f1a de RetroAchievements en el menu de tu emulador, escoje Achievement Sets y vas a ver esta ventana: Aqui agrupamos todos los logros disponibles en tres sets: Logros Core (los principales, set publico de logros), Unofficial/User Achievements (publicos, pero no otorgan puntos: para revision), Local Achievements (personales, en tu PC). En la venta de Logros, haz click en Local Achievements (superior izquierda), luego en Add New Achievement (superior derecha). Esto va a\u00f1adir una entrada vacia en la lista del centro.

La principal seria la parte de 'Requisitos' Vamos a decir que queremos agregar un logro por coleccionar cierto numero de anillos. Vamos a decir 15 por simplicidad. Despues de llenar los campos de arriba y a ver seleccionado un icono apropiado (en este ejemplo estamos utilizando la medalla del trofeo dorado (00136), pero tu puedes subir una nueva), ocupamos llenar los requisitos. Tenemos un requisito, ese numero de anillos tiene que ser minimo 15 . El siguiente click seria en Add New Requirement . Clickear este boton va a agregar algunos valores por default a la lista de requisitos. Los valores por defaults simplemente se percatan que algo relativamente sensible se agrego a la lista. Por ahora, ignorando el campo 'Special?'. Cuando clickeamos en crear, el valor default en memoria va a ser el ultimo valor que dejaste en la ventana de memoria. Lo siguiente seria cambiar estos valores a los siguientes: Size : 16-bit Memory : 0xfe20 Cmp : >= - esta es la comparacion que vamos a hacer. Podemos tener cualquier comparacion aqui, pero es sencible que tengas un \"mayor que e igual a\". Esto es importante porque si tenemos 10 anillos y despues obtenemos 10 anillos de una caja de 10 anillos vamos a tener 20, y vamos a perder el logro ya que tendriamos que tener exactamente 15 anillos.

Para estar seguros, tenemos que guardar nuestro progreso presionando Save Local ! Esto guarda todo localmente para asegurar que no perdamos ningun progreso.

Conceitos b\u00e1sicos link Tecnicamente, uma conquista (no contexto de RetroAchievements) \u00e9 um grupo de condi\u00e7\u00f5es que devem ser cumpridas em um determinado frame do jogo. Quando voc\u00ea inicia um jogo em um emulador com o recurso RetroAchievements, o emulador sempre verifica se essas condi\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o atendidas no frame atual.

Confira os v\u00eddeos no youtube . Primeiros passos link Antes de come\u00e7ar, certifique-se de ter um emulador RA da p\u00e1gina do RetroAchievements Download Page primeiro e crie uma conta para que voc\u00ea possa fazer login usando o emulador. Neste guia, estaremos usando RAGens para demonstrar, e o jogo Sonic the Hedgehog . Estamos usando RAGens, mas o mesmo se aplica aos outros emuladores. Para come\u00e7ar, execute o RAGens e fa\u00e7a o login quando solicitado. Em seguida, use File -> Open e selecione qualquer ROM que voc\u00ea deseja encontrar conquistas. Memory Inspector link Agora voc\u00ea deve ter sua janela principal executando o Sonic. Existem 3 outros di\u00e1logos que usaremos, que podem ser encontrados em RetroAchievements no menu. Em primeiro lugar, tratamos primeiro o Memory Inspector: O Memory Inspector pode ser usado para encontrar endere\u00e7os na RAM para que possamos usar. Essencialmente, voc\u00ea est\u00e1 em uma ca\u00e7ada ao tesouro para locais de mem\u00f3ria - este di\u00e1logo ir\u00e1 ajud\u00e1-lo a examinar e filtrar a RAM do jogo enquanto o jogo est\u00e1 sendo executado. NOTA: Se voc\u00ea quer uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o passo a passo de v\u00eddeo para encontrar endere\u00e7os de mem\u00f3ria, este video esse v\u00eddeo pode ser muito \u00fatil . V\u00eddeo em ingl\u00eas Para iniciar ou reiniciar um teste, clique em New 8-bit Test perto do meio na parte superior. Para manter as coisas simples, come\u00e7aremos procurando pelo endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria que contenha o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is que coletamos. Nossas etapas ser\u00e3o as seguintes: Carregue a ROM e comece um novo jogo. Redefinir a caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria: clique em New 8-bit Test . Retorne ao jogo e altere o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is na mem\u00f3ria. Por exemplo, colete um anel. Na caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria, agora queremos filtrar por valores que sejam \"maiores do que valores anteriores\" (s\u00edmbolo>). Selecionamos isso, ent\u00e3o, clique em Filter . Cada vez que voc\u00ea executa 3 e 4, o n\u00famero de possibilidades ou 'candidatos' diminuir\u00e1. Continuaremos a faz\u00ea-lo at\u00e9 que o n\u00famero de candidatos alcance um n\u00famero muito pequeno (o menor poss\u00edvel), pode demorar 4-5 tentativas. Em seguida, podemos clicar na janela de resultados e monitorar o endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria no visor de mem\u00f3ria na parte inferior. Continue usando o jogo e voc\u00ea deve ver os valores em mudan\u00e7a de mem\u00f3ria \u00e0 medida que voc\u00ea coleciona an\u00e9is. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o, ou se algo n\u00e3o parece direito, tente outro valor. Com o primeiro Sonic the Hedgehog, o endere\u00e7o da mem\u00f3ria para o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is deve ser 0xfe20. Nota : Usando estados de salvamento (F5 para salvar o estado, F8 para carregar o estado, F6-F7 para alternar o estado a ser usado), voc\u00ea pode alternar entre estados diferentes, permitindo alterar o que est\u00e1 na RAM e usar isso para filtrar fora candidatos ruins. Voc\u00ea pode procurar por valores que permanecem os mesmos (ou seja, se voc\u00ea sabe que o valor n\u00e3o mudou, use =) ou valores diferentes (use 'not equal', symbol! =). Nota : Infelizmente nenhuma garantia de jogo para jogo sobre como os desenvolvedores armazenaram seus dados (decimais de codigo bin\u00e1rio de 4 bits, 8 bits, 16 bits, negativos / invertidos, ou seja, usando 0xff / 0xffff para representar 'set' , ou simples, aleatoriamente), mas, eventualmente, voc\u00ea deve encontrar um bom endere\u00e7o. Observe se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 lutando para encontrar bons valores, postar o f\u00f3rum de Ajuda de desenvolvimento RetroAchievements.org Development Help forum ou o servidor RetroAchievements Discord server . H\u00e1 muitas pessoas que ficar\u00e3o muito felizes em ajudar! Dica : se voc\u00ea quiser experimentar a mem\u00f3ria, tente inserir novos valores diretamente no visualizador de RAM. Isso pode ter efeitos devastadores no jogo, ou pode fazer exatamente o que voc\u00ea espera, (ou nada!) Pode ser \u00fatil, para ver se voc\u00ea pode inserir um valor e obter o resultado esperado. Use com cuidado! Quando voc\u00ea encontrou um endere\u00e7o com o qual voc\u00ea est\u00e1 feliz, voc\u00ea pode escrever uma nota curta para o que \u00e9 e clicar em Salvar nota, isso ir\u00e1 armazen\u00e1-lo no banco de dados e ser\u00e1 restaurado automaticamente na pr\u00f3xima vez que voc\u00ea carregar o visor de mem\u00f3ria para isso jogo onde quer que esteja! Note que depois de clicar em \"Salvar nota\", a nota ser\u00e1 armazenada automaticamente no banco de dados, e compartilhada para que todos os desenvolvedores compartilhem o acesso a essas notas de mem\u00f3ria. Todos ser\u00e3o baixados de novo quando voc\u00ea carregar uma ROM. Se voc\u00ea tentar substituir uma nota, verificar\u00e1 com voc\u00ea primeiro antes de enviar. Voc\u00ea pode encontrar Dicas de Escava\u00e7\u00e3o de Mem\u00f3ria aqui .

V\u00e1 para o RetroAchievements no menu, escolha Achievement Sets e voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 esta caixa de di\u00e1logo: Aqui agrupamos todas as conquistas que conhecemos em tr\u00eas conjuntos: Core Achievements (o principal, conjunto de conquistas p\u00fablico), Unofficial/User Achievements (p\u00fablico, mas n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 premiar pontos, \u00e9 apenas para outros desenvolvedores revisarem), Local Achievements (pessoais no seu PC). Na caixa de di\u00e1logo Conquistas, clique em Local Achievements (canto superior esquerdo), depois em Add New Achievement (inferior esquerda). Isso ir\u00e1 adicionar uma entrada em branco \u00e0 lista no centro. Clique duas vezes nele: se ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 aberto, isso deve selecion\u00e1-lo e abrir a caixa de di\u00e1logo Editor de conquista ( Achievement Editor ). Achievement Editor link O Achievement Editor se parece com isso: Esta \u00e9 a \u00faltima caixa de di\u00e1logo onde reunimos todos os dados juntos. A maioria dos principais campos s\u00e3o auto-explicativos, ou seja, Title, Description, Points. A principal \u00e9 a parte de 'Requirements' (Requisitos). Digamos que queremos adicionar uma conquista para colecionar um certo n\u00famero de an\u00e9is. Digamos 15 an\u00e9is para simplificar. Depois de preencher os campos na parte superior e selecionar um \u00edcone adequado (neste exemplo, usamos o distintivo de trof\u00e9u de ouro (00136), mas voc\u00ea pode carregar um novo), precisamos preencher os Requisitos. Temos um requisito, que o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is \u00e9 pelo menos 15 . O pr\u00f3ximo clique \u00e9 Add New Requirement . Ao clicar neste bot\u00e3o, ser\u00e3o adicionados v\u00e1rios valores padr\u00e3o \u00e0 lista Requisitos. Esses padr\u00f5es apenas garantem que algo relativamente sens\u00edvel seja adicionado \u00e0 lista. Por enquanto, ignorando o campo 'Special?'. Quando clicamos em criar, o valor de mem\u00f3ria padr\u00e3o ser\u00e1 o valor que voc\u00ea deixou pela \u00faltima vez na caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria. Em seguida, alteraremos esses valores para o seguinte: Size : 16 bits . Memory : 0xfe20 . Cmp: >= - esta \u00e9 a compara\u00e7\u00e3o a fazer. Podemos ter alguma compara\u00e7\u00e3o aqui, mas \u00e9 sensato ter \"maior ou igual\". Isso \u00e9 importante porque, se conseguimos 10 an\u00e9is, ent\u00e3o uma caixa de super anel para ter 20, perder\u00edamos exatamente 15 an\u00e9is.

Para manter as coisas simples, come\u00e7aremos procurando pelo endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria que contenha o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is que coletamos. Nossas etapas ser\u00e3o as seguintes: Carregue a ROM e comece um novo jogo. Redefinir a caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria: clique em New 8-bit Test . Retorne ao jogo e altere o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is na mem\u00f3ria. Por exemplo, colete um anel. Na caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria, agora queremos filtrar por valores que sejam \"maiores do que valores anteriores\" (s\u00edmbolo>). Selecionamos isso, ent\u00e3o, clique em Filter . Cada vez que voc\u00ea executa 3 e 4, o n\u00famero de possibilidades ou 'candidatos' diminuir\u00e1. Continuaremos a faz\u00ea-lo at\u00e9 que o n\u00famero de candidatos alcance um n\u00famero muito pequeno (o menor poss\u00edvel), pode demorar 4-5 tentativas. Em seguida, podemos clicar na janela de resultados e monitorar o endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria no visor de mem\u00f3ria na parte inferior.

Nota : Usando estados de salvamento (F5 para salvar o estado, F8 para carregar o estado, F6-F7 para alternar o estado a ser usado), voc\u00ea pode alternar entre estados diferentes, permitindo alterar o que est\u00e1 na RAM e usar isso para filtrar fora candidatos ruins.

Basic Concepts link Technically an achievement is a group of conditions that must be met in a particular frame of the video game . When you launch a game on an emulator with the RetroAchievements feature, the emulator is always checking if those conditions are met in the current frame. When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement. The process of creating an achievement basically involves 3 steps: Finding a place in the game's RAM where the information you want is stored (examples: level, life bar, time, coins, holding a weapon, get an item, etc.). Create conditions that must be met in order to award an Achievement. Test if your achievement is working as expected. Most likely you'll go back to step 2 and 3 many times to refine the logic of your Achievement. In this doc we'll see how to accomplish the steps above. After you're sure your achievement is triggering at the conditions you want, you can submit it to the server. We'll see more about it later. First Steps link Before start ensure you have an RA emulator from the RetroAchievements Download Page first and create an account so you can log in using the emulator. In this guide we'll be using RALibRetro with the Genesis Plus GX core to demonstrate, and the game Sonic the Hedgehog . We are using RALibRetro but the same applies for the standalone emulators. To begin, run the RALibRetro executable and login when prompted. If you have not used the Genesis Plus GX core before, you can install it by going to Settings -> Manage Cores -> selecting Sega Genesis in the drop down menu -> clicking Download to the right of the core name. Once the core is installed, go to File -> Select Core -> Sega Genesis -> Genesis Plus GX. Now that you have the core selected, you'll need to load the game. Go to File -> Load Game and select the Sonic the Hedgehog ROM (we recommend using No Intro ROMs by default). Memory Inspector link You should now have your main window running Sonic. There are 3 other dialogs we'll be using, which can be found under RetroAchievements in the menu. We'll be dealing with the Memory Inspector first: The Memory Inspector can be used to find addresses in RAM for us to use. Essentially you are on a treasure hunt for memory locations - this dialog will help you examine and filter the game's RAM while the game is running. NOTE: If you want a step-by-step video explanation on finding memory addresses, this old video can be useful . See also : Memory Inspector Overview and Memory Digging Tips . To start or restart a test, click Reset near the top left. To keep things simple, we'll start by looking for the memory address which holds the number of rings we have collected. Our steps will be the following: Load the ROM and start a new game. Reset the memory dialog: click Reset . Run the first filter: click Filter Once . Return to the game and change the number of rings in memory. For example, collect a ring. In the memory dialog, we now want to filter for values that are 'greater than previous values' (symbol > ). We select this, then hit Filter again. Each time you perform 4 then 5, the number of possibilities or 'candidates' will get smaller. We will continue doing this until the number of candidates reaches a very small number (as few as possible), it can take several attempts. Next we can click in the results window, and monitor the memory address in the memory viewer at the bottom. Continue using the game and you should see the values in memory change as you collect rings. If you don't, or if something doesn't look right, try another value. With the first Sonic the Hedgehog, the memory address for the number of rings should be 0xfe20 . Note 1 : Using save states (Shift+F1-F10 to save states, F1-F10 to load states), you can switch back and forth between different states allowing you to alter what is in RAM, and use this to filter out bad candidates. You can search for values that remain the same (I.e. If you know the value didn't change, use = ), or values that are different (use 'not equal', symbol != ). Using the example above, you can collect a ring then use the \">\" filter, take a few steps then use the \"=\" filter (since the number of rings did not change), collect more rings and use the \">\" filter again, etc. Note 2 : There's unfortunately no guarantee from game to game on how the developers have stored their data (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, binary-coded decimals, negative/inverted, i.e. using 0xff/0xffff to represent 'set', or plain randomly), but eventually you should come across some good addresses. Note if you are struggling to find good values, post in RetroAchievements.org Development Help forum , or RetroAchievements Discord server . There are plenty of people who will be very happy to help!! Tip : if you'd like to experiment with memory, try entering new values directly into the RAM viewer. This can have devastating effects on the game, or it might do exactly what you expect, (or nothing at all!) It can be useful though, to see if you can enter a value and get the result you expect. Use with caution! When you've found an address you're happy with, you can write a short note for what it is and hit Save Note , this will store it on database, and will be automatically restored next time you load up the memory viewer for this game, wherever you are! Note that after clicking 'Save Note', the note will be automatically stored on the database, and shared so all developers will share access to these memory notes. They will all be downloaded afresh when you load a ROM. If you try to overwrite a note, it will check with you first before submitting. You can find more useful Memory Digging Tips here . Achievement Sets link So the memory location for the number of rings is stored at 0xfe20 - note to a non-programmer, we're dealing in hexadecimal numeral system which can be daunting, but don't worry, essentially it's just numbers and letters instead of only numbers, and not forgetting 0x at the start to show that it's a memory location in hex. We've found an address we're interested in and stored it using Save Note . We now want to create a new achievement. Go to the RetroAchievements in the menu, choose Achievement Sets and you'll see this dialog: Here we group all the achievements we know about into three sets: Core Achievements (the main, public Achievement set), Unofficial/User Achievements (public, but will not award you points: for peer review), Local Achievements (exclusive to your PC). In the Achievements dialog, click Local Achievements (top left), then Add New Achievement (top right). This will add a blank entry to the list in the center. Double click on it: if it's not already open, this should select it and open the Achievement Editor dialog. Achievement Editor link This is how it looks: This is the final dialog where we bring all the data together. Most of the top fields are self explanatory, I.e. Title, Description, Points. The main one is the 'Requirements' part. Let's say we want to add an achievement for collecting a certain number of rings. Let's say 15 rings for simplicity. After filling out the fields at the top and selecting a suitable icon (in this example we used the gold trophy badge (00136), but you can upload a new one), we need to fill out Requirements. We have one requirement, that the number of rings is at least 15 . Next click is Add New Requirement . Clicking this button will add several default values to the Requirements list. These defaults just ensure that something relatively sensible is added to the list. For now, ignoring the field 'Special?'. When we clicked create, the default memory value will be whatever value you last left in the memory dialog. Next we will change these values to the following: Size : 16-bit - we're using 16-bit because the value can exceed 255 (which is 0xff in hex) Memory : 0xfe20 Cmp : >= - this is the comparison to make. We could have any comparison here, but it's sensible to have \"greater than or equal to\". This is important because if we get 10 rings then a super ring box to have 20, we would miss out having exactly 15 rings. Type : Value - we're comparing this memory value to a fixed value: 15 Size : Empty - this is only relevant when comparing memory to memory Mem/Val : 15 - the number of rings required: the value we are comparing the memory to Hit Count : 0 - ignore this for now, its useful for when something needs to happen a certain number of times With that set, we don't have any more conditions to add, so we return to the Achievements Dialog . To be safe, we should save our progress by hitting Save Local ! This saves everything to file locally to ensure that we won't lose any progress. Note : An achievement should have more than one requirement to avoid it triggering at the wrong time (i.e. playing demo mode). In this example, we are using only one requirement to simplify the explanation. See more Achievement Creation Tips here . Testing the Achievement link We can now 'activate' this achievement locally by checking the box next to Active on the right-hand side in the Achievement Editor or by selecting the achievement in Achievement Sets and clicking Activate Selected . This will start monitoring these memory locations and will award the achievement once all the conditions are true. Now we can go ahead and test to see if this achievement works! If we press Esc in-game, you will see the achievement show up as a demonstration of what it would look like in the in-game overlay! Although the achievement worked fine in our tests, an achievement with logic like that is not ready to be officially released. First of all, it has only one condition: \"collected rings >= 15\". The problem is that the memory address used to record the number of collected rings is also used when the game runs in \"demo mode\" (AI playing the game after you wait a while on the title screen). So, if Sonic collects 15 rings in demo mode this achievement will trigger, which is unwanted. Check the tips in the next section below to know how to improve the logic of your achievement and then make it acceptable to be officially released. Important Tips link Here are some tips you have to keep in mind when creating your achievements: Never Avoid making achievements with only one condition as much as you can . Otherwise it will most likely pop at the wrong time. This is the most common error by a developer If the game has a demo mode (AI plays the game after you wait a while on the title screen), make sure to find the address for it and add a condition so your achievements don't trigger in demo mode. You'll also need to know how to use PauseIf and ResetIf . PauseIf cheat codes : If the game has a cheat code to increase lives, select stages, etc., make sure to find the addresses for it and add some kind of protection in your achievements. OK, maybe it's not a very basic topic, but you have to keep it in mind when creating an official achievement set. Avoid creating achievements for just entering a stage. As it can be earned by a password or a stage select cheat code. It is preferred to make achievements for finishing stages, like in this template here . Also, do not create achievements for just starting a game or \"starting a game with character X\" . If you want to create an achievement for getting a unique item in the game, add some conditions to make sure the player obtained the item where it is supposed to be obtained, like in this template here . Otherwise the achievement can be earned by using password or loading a saved game. Avoid making too many achievements about simple things that require minimal effort . Examples of what NOT to do: get one coin or one mushroom on Super Mario Bros. Be aware of the unwelcome achievement's design concepts . Be creative with your achievements . Those covering unique features and details of the game are the most welcome. The players love when that little detail of a game they love is supported on an achievement. Reading a walkthrough on GameFAQs can give some inspiration too. It can take a while to understand how the memory works in a game, so try spending as much time with it as you can, especially if it's your first attempt at developing achievements. You can find more in the Tips and Tricks page . Next Steps link Now that you know how to use the Memory Inspector, and the Achievement Editor. It's time to learn new techniques and practice: In order to refine your achievement logic, you can see what features you have in the Achievement Logic Features page. Another way to learn is by looking at existing achievements that other devs made with an extra explanation in the Real Examples page. You can also see some generic examples in the Achievement Templates page. Once you have learned the basic techniques, you can continue your quest to become an achievement developer by following the steps explained here: How to Become an Achievement Developer Have fun!

In general, a player must unlock achievements: using the latest release version of an approved supported emulator; inside of a game by in-game actions; by their own control; without outside-modifying game files or game code; without using another player\u2019s save files or passwords, and; without using outside cheat programs. These rules are designed to keep players honest in their gameplay and honest towards each other in Global Leaderboard competition. Table of Contents link Global Leaderboard Hardcore mode Untracked Not Allowed Allowed Penalties for Cheating How to Clean and Appeal Cheating If You Need Help Special Thanks Global Leaderboard link The RetroAchievements global leaderboard is the main official community competition. This includes a unique site rank based on the sum of achievement points earned in comparison with every other ranked player. Each account with points greater than 0 is ranked by default. What is considered fair and legitimate play versus unfair (cheating) on the global leaderboard has been shaped continually by the community since it's inception. The rules below are what we expect from every player who would like to participate in the ranking system. Any indication of a player's failure to follow the rules herein may lose use of the global leaderboard, also known as Untracked status. Hardcore mode link Hardcore mode is a feature where the emulator disables all savestate ability, rewind and the slow motion. The fast-forward feature is the only accepted exception . When playing in hardcore mode the points you earn worth double the achievement's points. So if the achievement set worths 400 points and you complete it in hardcore mode you'll get 800 points. Users who take the global leaderboard seriously will most likely earn achievements in hardcore mode to get more points. NOTE : when playing with hardcore mode disabled (also known as \"softcore\"), expect to have some issues. Read in this link Why you shouldn't use the load state feature . Untracked link An untracked account doesn't appear in the global ranking, its activities do not appear in the feed, it's no longer listed among all other earners of each achievement (on the achievement page) and their entries on specific leaderboards will not be publicly visible. However an untracked account still can enjoy the RetroAchievements and get the badges for completing games. This status was created so people can do whatever they want with their accounts (like cheating or sharing the account between friends/family) without messing with the fair competitive aspect of the global leaderboards. So, if you want to enjoy the RetroAchievements but not compete in the global leaderboard you can ask to have your account untracked. Just send a message to RAdmin requesting that. Not Allowed link Do not use methods that circumvent achievement code to instantly unlock achievements. Do not earn achievements in a way that is unintended by the achievement developer. Do not use save files or passwords that are not your own or were made by under other conditions of play. Do not modify the game's file(s) or memory by any means. Do not use game files or programs known as \"trainers\". Do not use TAS (tool-assisted speedrunning), bots, or complex scripting to gain achievements. Do not allow other people to access your account and earn achievements for you. Do not be abusive to developers. Do not create or share cheating methods. Do not use in-game cheat codes unless it is specified as allowed by the developer. 1. Do not use methods that circumvent achievement code to instantly unlock achievements. link Even if you \"should have\" unlocked the achievement. Even if the game is bugged. Even if the achievement is removed or broken entirely. When it's detected it will most likely lead the account to be Untracked . In the cases where you should have unlocked the achievement but it didn't triggered or it didn't get registered in the site due to a network problem, you should follow the steps described in FAQ to request a manual unlock . NOTE : be sure you are using the latest release version of an approved supported emulator. 2. Do not earn achievements in a way that is unintended by the achievement developer. link If you discover a back-door to an achievement this is a bug. Please report this bug using a ticket report. See also the allowed rule 2 . Examples: You unlock achievements for finishing levels via a level select cheat code, it's a bug and must be reported/fixed. You notice that if you go back and forth between two rooms you unlock achievements intended for progressing though the game. You've found a method of earning a damageless boss achievements while taking damage during the fights. 3. Do not use save files or passwords that are not your own or were made by under other conditions of play. link Occasionally a developer might provide a save file or password for you to use to earn certain achievements. This is appropriate according to the judgement of the set developer. Examples : Downloading a clicker game save online. Begging a friend to send you his save file because your house burned down and you lost all your PC files. Loading a save file for Hardcore you created in a while playing on a non-RA emulator. Loading a save file for Hardcore you created in Softcore in order to gain Hardcore points. 4. Do not modify the game's file(s) or memory by any means. link Examples : Opening up specific game files with a text/hex editor and changing values to what you want; editing properties such as \"read-only\" for game files; etc. Editing the stats or unlocks in a game, and then saving the data. 5. Do not use game files or programs known as \"trainers\". link Programs which can boost your powers in games, unlock debug modes, speed the game up, modify game code, etc. Examples : Using a trainer program for anything. Using trained ROMs for any game (they will not be linked). Using unofficial/old mods/emulators that act as trainers or debug/cheat toolsets. Game Genie / Action Replay and other such similar cheat tools. 6. Do not use TAS (tool-assisted speedrunning), bots, or complex scripting to gain achievements. link These are all advanced scripting of a game far beyond simple tasks (sometimes even synced to clockspeed) to allow complex, unique, and/or non-monotonous/non-repetitive sections of a game to be played without human interaction. Examples : using a TAS to complete a difficult speedrun or no-death achievement. using a complex script with advanced functionality. using complex scripts that complete entire games or large portions of games with no human input but requiring many unique actions. 7. Do not allow other users to access your account and earn achievements for you. link Including your \"little brother\" or your \"cousin\". You must earn your achievements yourself. Letting people earn achievements on your account is not allowed in general and if anyone cheats or breaks the rules on your account, you will still be held accountable. Examples : Having a friend who is more skilled at a game complete a difficult section for you in a single-player game. Letting someone log into your RA account to beat a difficult part of a game for you. Letting your little brother work on a grindy achievement for you. 8. Do not be abusive to developers link Via forums, PMs, discord, email, etc. You\u2019re allowed to complain, ask for changes, leave negative reviews/comments and other such respectful criticisms, but you give all of us in the achievement hunting community a really bad name when you harass/attack developers because of what they did to their game\u2019s achievements. Examples : Issuing threats or flagrant insults to devs because they added achievements to their game that you do not like; using extreme/excessive rudeness while demanding a developer remove or change achievements; etc. 9. Do not create or share cheating methods. link Examples : Teaching someone how to use memory hacking tools. Posting on the forums to promote an egregious game file edit method. Sending someone a link to memory hacking tools or a trainer programs. Teaching someone how to hide cheating. Creating a non-allowed complex script and sharing it around even if you never use it yourself. 10. Do not use in-game cheat codes unless it is specified as allowed by the developer. link The other side of the coin for allowed 2 . Cheat codes and debug modes are not allowed unless the developer has made note of which and when it is allowed. Even if the achievements are earnable with cheat codes this is usually unintended behavior, considered cheating if done intentionally, and should be reported as a bug via the ticket system. Allowed link Fast-forward is allowed. When explicitly said in achievement's description , in-game cheat codes/modes and in-game debug tools are allowed. Making use of in-game glitches, in-game exploits, and \"cheesy\" tactics are allowed. Using online guides/walkthroughs is allowed. Playing co-op/competitive games with another player or players is allowed. Turbo is allowed. 1. Fast-forward is allowed. link Even in hardcore mode fast-forward is allowed, as a modern convenience. It's almost a consensus that fast-forward offers no risk to the fairplay and then it's available for everyone to use it. NOTE : in softcore mode savestates, rewind and slow motion are also allowed, but expect to have some issues. Read in this link Why you shouldn't use the load state feature . 2. When explicitly said in achievement's description , in-game cheat codes/modes and in-game debug tools are allowed. link This is a complement to the not allowed rule 2 . The achievement developer's are instructed to protect their work so the achievements can't be unlocked easily by simply using a cheat code . However, some cool and fun challenges can be created taking advantage of some cheats. In these specific cases, using in-game cheats are allowed. NOTE : if you find achievements unlockable by using in-game cheats with no pertinent description, consider opening a ticket and reporting it. Examples : In Tetris (Game Boy) you should activate the speed cheat to earn the Challenge of the Gods achievement, where you have to clear 20 lines on speed 19. In Guerrilla War (NES) you're allowed to use the \"level and difficulty select screen\" cheat to earn the achievements where you have to beat the stages without killing any hostages. 3. Making use of in-game glitches, in-game exploits, and \"cheesy\" tactics are allowed. link In-game glitches/exploits/cheesy tactics are allowed, however developers can code their achievements to disallow them programatically. It's usually mentioned in the achievement's description. This does not include when there are flaws in the achievement developer's code. In such cases, please create a ticket report, and earn the achievement as intended by the developer. See also not allowed rule 2 . Examples : Breaking out out of normal bounds to avoid enemies. Doing something strange inside of a game to \"bug a game out\" so you become invincible. Accessing powerful items earlier than intended. Standing somewhere enemies can\u2019t hit you. Examples where developers disallow it : Megaman (NES) - beat bosses damageless without using the pause glitch. 4. Using online guides/walkthroughs is allowed. link Examples : youtube video guides; GameFAQs; puzzle solutions; collectible lists; etc. A note on honesty : Using solvers for sudoku/picross is considered cheating. Unenforceable tolerated cheating but cheating nonetheless. 5. Playing co-op/competitive games with another player or players is allowed. link Playing co-op is allowed, however developers can code their achievements to disallow them programatically. It's usually mentioned in the achievement's description. See also not allowed rule 2 . Examples : a skilled friend playing Streets of Rage or Goof Troop with you; etc. 6. Turbo is allowed. link Turbo is where you hold a single button down and the button is automatically re-pressed again and again quickly. Turbo is either built into controllers, or into emulation software. In either case it is allowed. In cases where there is any more complex scripting than repeating the same button in quick succession, this is not allowed. See Not allowed 6 . Penalties for Cheating link Upon cheating being detected, the account will be set as Untracked . There are some cases where the account will be banned. How to Clean and Appeal Cheating link The fastest way: Reset all your points. If you've been previously untracked and would like it reversed please inform RAdmin of your action. If you have ways to prove you played without cheating, send a message to RAdmin, but keep in mind that RA staff are all volunteers and it can take time to judge your case. If you wish to come forward and admit cheating, this will be greatly appreciated and taken into consideration during your appeal. If You Need Help link If you ever have a question, comment, or suggestions - feel welcome to contact RAdmin or the RA staff (@mods and @admins) on our discord server. These rules will be amended from time to time as needed. Special Thanks link This document is heavily based on the 100Pals Unified Achievement Hunting Rules .

Antes de que se empezara este proyecto la informaci\u00f3n sobre el desarrollo de logros estaba esparcida en varios posts del foro en RetroAchievements.org, haciendo la experiencia de aprendizaje mas complicada para el desarrollador novato. Este proyecto comenz\u00f3 trayendo el material de los posts del foro hacia aqu\u00ed, pero en un orden mas ordenado y coherente. La Documentaci\u00f3n de RetroAchievements se divide en dos partes: Wiki de RetroAchievements Documentos de RetroAchievements La wiki es donde los documentos son creados y editados. Cualquiera (con una cuenta de github) es capaz de editar el contenido de la wiki. As\u00ed que, si tienes algo que compartir, por favor edita la wiki! El sitio web de los documentos de RetroAchievements tiene (la mayor\u00eda) el mismo contenido que la wiki, pero con un look mas placentero. El contenido de este sitio web es generado por sus moderadores utilizando el contenido de la wiki como su m\u00e9todo de entrada. Cuando un cambio es hecho en la wiki este cambio NO es instant\u00e1neamente reflejado en los documentos. La conversi\u00f3n es realizada por un moderador cada cierto tiempo.

These requirement are also a checklist for Code Reviewers (developers who inspect the code of new developers). Anyone can become a RetroAchievements developer if they put in the effort. Strongly recommended : join our Discord server so you can get in contact with other achievement developers who can show you the ropes and help you along. If you already know what game you want to work on, go ahead and ask for the jr-dev role. This gives you access to the #jr-devs channel, where you can talk to code reviewers and ask any development related questions. Finding a Game to Work on link Follow the guidelines on the Developer's Code of Conduct to find a game to work on achievements for it. The basics are that you must declare you plans to work on the game on in the forum, and then as you work on the game, add your plans for the game in the forum. Tip : for your first achievement set it's recommended to choose a game that doesn't yet have achievements and is not very popular. Planning your Achievement Set link Once you find a game to work on you need to plan your Achievement Set. Be sure you know enough about the game to make a good set. Check the GameFAQs or something, try to learn more about the game, its secrets and details. Here is a good guide to help you with this: Set Development Roadmap . Post your plans on the official game's forum topic, so the community can leave suggestions and provide feedback. This is required behavior for all devs and jr-dev. IMPORTANT!: be open to receive feedback and suggestions. See also : Achievement Design , it's an extensive guide on how to design good and interesting achievements. It's not about the technical side but the conceptual. Required Knowledge link Every developer must know at least the basic concepts and techniques shown in these two docs: Getting Started as an Achievement Developer Achievement Logic Features Any aspiring dev must demonstrate understanding of the following concepts: Basic RAM digging (be familiar with the Memory Inspector ) Hexadecimal notation Delta values Hit counts Pause If Reset If Alt Groups Memory sizes: 8-bit and single bit Achievement logic comparisons besides = , such as > , < , != Adding badges to an achievment Creating accurate descriptions for achievements Add appropriate protections Make a stable achievement set Note : You do not need mastery of all these concepts to have a set published, but you do need them to have the full Developer role. Advanced Concepts link Here is a list of some advanced concepts/techniques. They are not required to become a Developer , but are listed here to let the jr-dev know the possibilities of the Achievement's logic. Hit count as timer (like in this example and this one ) ResetIf Checkpoints ResetIf with Hitcount PauseIf with Hitcount AddSource and SubSource Flags AddHits and SubHits Flag Increment counter ( Mem > Delta Counter) Delta Hit Counter, pause technique Little endianness Memory size: Lower4, Upper4 , and 16-bit, 32-bit Dynamic Rich Presence Leaderboards Pausable Resets SubSource increment counter The Real Examples and Achievement Templates pages are useful resources to see how those techniques work. Code Notes link Non-devs can create and delete code notes that they have created, but they cannot delete or edit any notes created by others. Developers CAN edit and remove notes by other users, and these changes are site-wide. Practicing link In order to become familiar to those techniques you must practice. You can use any game to practice , even those that already have achievements. Just be aware about these rules: Do NOT delete/overwrite any existing Code Note. On this practicing phase, keep your work in local and do NOT upload any achievement. You'll do it later when you find a game to actually work on. Get your work reviewed link After creating some achievements, upload them to Unofficial and then contact a @mod or @code-reviewer on our Discord server (if you don't use Discord, send a message to RAdmin ) and ask them to find someone to review your work. Do NOT ask another developer to promote your achievements to the Core without a proper review. Again, it's extremely important that you are open to receive constructive criticism and helpful advice from the community at any time . Am I ready to get the Developer status? link Once the Code Reviewers have inspected your achievement's code and concepts, they and the admin will use the \"Required Knowledge\" checklist above to determine if you're ready. If you're not fully qualified to be a developer but but your set is complete and stable the set will get published. You can then ask which concepts you still need to demonstrate proficiency in to be given developer status. The merit of a jr-dev receiving developer status depends on: their ability to publish work that meets the standards of the Developer's Code of Conduct ; demonstration of required knowledge and advanced concepts ; the quality and complexity of their work; the time and thought they put into planning and working on achievements; showing the will to use the Developer status with care and responsibility; the extent to which the points above reflect their capabilities as a developer. Developer's Code of Conduct link Once you get your Developer status, you MUST adhere to the Developer's Code of Conduct . That is extremely important to create a fair environment between the Achievement Developers.

This page will attempt to walk you through doing the second. Add a second \"Window Capture\" source to the Scene. In the popup dialog, select the \"TransparentOverlayWindow\". You'll probably notice the window is pink. Add a filter to the second \"Window Capture\" Add a \"Color Key\" filter, set the Key Color Type to \"Custom Color\", then use the Select Color dialog to enter #FF01FE as the color. Decrease the similarity to 1 and the opacity to 90. Finally, if you still have a bit of a pink border showing up, enable a Scale Filter.

Es una interfaz bastante tosca y un trabajo algo complicado hacer que una tabla funcione de manera correcta. As\u00ed que en este documento vamos a intentar a entender como funciona. Visiones Generales link Asi es como se ve una lista de Tablas de Clasificaci\u00f3n de un juego en el sitio web: En el centro puedes llegar a ver cada Tabla que a sido creada, y en la columna de la derecha puedes llegar a ver las Notas de C\u00f3digo del Juego. Las Notas est\u00e1n all\u00ed para ayudar en algunas de las condiciones que se encuentran aqu\u00ed abajo. Aqu\u00ed hay una breve explicaci\u00f3n de cada campo que se encuentra en una Tabla de Clasificacion: Titulo : El titulo de la tabla. Descripci\u00f3n : La descripci\u00f3n de la tabla. Formato : Puede llegar a ser Puntuaci\u00f3n , Tiempo (Frames) , Tiempo (Milisegundos) o Valor . Se utiliza para distinguir que tipo de tabla es (vamos a ver mas sobre esto mas abajo). \"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox : cuando se encuentra activada, significa que el valor mas bajo es mejor. Es usualmente el caso para logros basados en tiempo. Start : condiciones para empezar la tabla, aka STA . Cancel : condiciones para cancelar la tabla, aka CAN . Submit : condiciones para subir una entrada a la tabla, aka SUB . Value : valor que quieres que se suba a la tabla, aka VAL . Nota : Una tabla valida TIENE que tener todas estas cuatro condiciones. Esos \u00faltimos 4 campos son realmente importantes y se tiene que tomar MUCHO cuidado de acuerdo a los datos que vas a introducir en ellas. Es por eso que requieren una explicaci\u00f3n a continuaci\u00f3n: La condici\u00f3n STA o Start son una serie de valores, como un logro, que tienen que llegar a ser verdad en orden para que la tabla empieza a buscar una entrada para la tabla. Una vez que STA es verdadero, el juego va a activar las otras tres constantemente. Si la condici\u00f3n Cancel ( CAN ) es verdadera, entonces esta va a cancelar la tabla y no se va a subir la entrada a la misma. Si la condici\u00f3n Submit ( SUB ) es verdadera, entonces la puntuaci\u00f3n entrara en las tablas. NOTA: Cancel tiene mas prioridad que Submit. Si las dos se convierten verdaderas en el mismo frame, la puntuaci\u00f3n no sera ingresada. Finalmente, Value ( VAL ) es un caso especial, y va a ser tomado de la memoria utilizando la formula que se ingreso en la entrada de Value. Esta es la puntuaci\u00f3n que se muestra cuando la Tabla esta activa, y el valor que es ingresado en las tablas si SUB es verdadero. NOTA: Una vez que una tabla activa es cancelada o ingresada, esta no puede ser re-activada asta que la condici\u00f3n Start se convierta en falsa, y verdadera de nuevo. Esto previene a la tabla de ser re-activada inmediatamente que se ingreso un valor o se cancelo. Formato de Direcciones link Las direcciones de memoria para STA/CAN/SUB/VAL tienen el siguiente formato: localizaci\u00f3n/tama\u00f1o prefijo (las letras pueden ser en min\u00fasculas) ejemplo bit0 0xM 0xM01234 bit1 0xN 0xN01234 bit2 0xO 0xO01234 bit3 0xP 0xP01234 bit4 0xQ 0xQ01234 bit5 0xR 0xR01234 bit6 0xS 0xS01234 bit7 0xT 0xT01234 Lower4 0xL 0xL01234 Upper4 0xU 0xU01234 8bit 0xH 0xH01234 16bit 0x 0x01234 32bit 0xX 0xX01234 Ejemplo link La mejor manera de empezar es hecharle un vistazo a una de las tablas ya existentes https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardList.php y abrirla para ver como funciona. Vamos a utilizar la tabla de Green Hill Act 1 (Sonic the Hedgehog) para este ejemplo. Entonces veamos como funciona: El Titulo/Descripci\u00f3n son algo obios. El Type es \"Time (Frames)\". En Sonic cada 60 frames es un 1 segundo, entonces vamos a monitoriar los segundo utilizando frames. La caja de Lower Is Better esta marcada, entonces aquel que consiga el tiempo mas corto sera el #1. Ahora vamos a desglosar las partes mas importantes. Condiciones de Start link STA : 0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0 0xfe10=h0000 : Si la direcci\u00f3n de 16-bit 0xfe10 en la RAM es equivalente a 0000 en hex, _ : Y, 0xhf601=h0c : Si la direcci\u00f3n de 8-bit 0xf601 en la RAM es equivalente a 0c en hex, _ : Y, d0xhf601!=h0c : Si la misma direcci\u00f3n anterior (0xf601) NO es equivalente a 0c en hex, _ : Y, 0xfff0=0 Si la direcci\u00f3n de 16-bit 0xfff0 en la RAM es equivalente a 0. Esto puede parecer desalentador, porque no sabes que significan esta direcciones. Es por eso que las Notas de C\u00f3digo en la columna de la derecha son bastante \u00fatiles! Tu puedes llegar a ver como estas direcciones son mostradas en memoria. En nuestro ejemplo tenemos: 0xfe10 es el nivel, y se espera que sea 0 (el primer nivel). 0xf601 es una direccion en memoria de 8-bit, y utilizamos el prefijo 0xh en vez de 0x . 0xf601 es el modo de la pantalla. La segunda y terceras partes de las condiciones para empezar estan diciendo \"el modo actual tiene que ser ingame ( 0c ), y el modo en el frame anterior NO tiene que ser ingame \". Nota : ese prefijo d en la direcci\u00f3n representa delta, o \"el valor en el frame anterior\". Sum\u00e1ndole a esto: ejecuta STA si ACABAMOS de llegar a un nivel, (para empezar a checar el tiempo). Finalmente tambi\u00e9n esperamos que 0xfff0 sea equivalente a 0 , ya que esta direcci\u00f3n se utiliza para demo mode, y no queremos que la tabla se active cuando esta el modo demo activado! Tip : el error mas com\u00fan cuando creamos tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n es olvidarnos de la h cuando tratamos de hacer referencia a un valor en memoria de 8-bit. Pro-tip: STA , CAN , y SUB soportan toda la logica que se encuentra disponible en el editor de logros . La manera mas facil es asegurarte que escribiste todo correctamente es crear logros locales que capturen estos eventos, y entonces extraer los valores ingresados en el archivo \"XXX-User.txt\" asociado al juego en el cual te encuentras trabajando. Condiciones para Cancelar link CAN : 0xhfe13<d0xhfe13 0xfe13 es el numero de vidas. La condici\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n checa si el contador de VIDAS alguna vez se decrementa. Literalmente dice \"Cancela si el valor ACTUAL en 0xfe13 es menor al valor ANTERIOR en 0xfe13\". Queremos hacer esto porque puedes llegar al ultimo checkpoint, morir y resetear tu tiempo a 0:00. Y no queremos que se pueda hacer esto, ya que no es la manera correcta de completar el nivel. As\u00ed que si el jugador muere, se va a resetear el progreso de la tabla. Finalmente, si conectas dos condiciones de cancelaci\u00f3n con una s , la tabla se va a cancelar si cualquiera de las condiciones es verdadera. Condiciones para Ingresar Entradas link SUB : 0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0 0xf7cc es la bandera para terminar el nivel, esta no es interactiva. La secci\u00f3n de submit checa si en el frame actual se encuentra la bandera de 'endlevel' como verdadera (o !=0 , 'no es un cero'), y el frame anterior (delta) lo tiene como falso (o =0 , 'cero'). Esto sugiere que el jugador a llegado al final del nivel. Tip : puede llegar a ser \u00fatil observar como trabajan estos valores en memoria, y conocer que tipo de valor se utilizan en diferente circunstancias. Interpretador de Valores link Tambi\u00e9n mira: C\u00f3digo Binario Formateado en Decimal VAL : 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 Finalmente, valor. Una vez que el jugador a llegado a la condici\u00f3n de inicio, se mostrara una notificaci\u00f3n en pantalla, mostrando el progreso del jugador en tiempo real. Si es una una tabla sobre tiempo, va a ver un reloj, y si es una puntuaci\u00f3n se mostrara simplemente el valor. Si ellos llegan a cumplir la condici\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n, se mostrara un mensaje diciendo que fallaron, y la notificaci\u00f3n sera removida. Si ellos cumplen la condici\u00f3n de submit exitosamente, el valor actual se va a tomar y se va a subir una entrada, aparecer\u00e1 una notificaci\u00f3n informando al jugador sobre su posici\u00f3n en las tablas. La condiciones en value son especiales en cierto aspectos. Es evaluada constantemente y se muestra en pantalla en tiempo real cuando una tabla esta activada. No trabaja como otras condiciones, interpreta las direcciones de la siguiente manera: direcci\u00f3n*modificador (direcci\u00f3n veces modificador) y usa al _ operador guion bajo como 'mas'. El asterisco * significa 'multiplicar', entonces en el valor 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 representa: 8-bit 0xfe24 1 vez, MAS 8-bit 0xfe25 60 veces, MAS 8-bit 0xfe22 3600 veces La raz\u00f3n de esto es que los valores de cada una de estas direcciones significan frames, segundos, y minutos respectivamente. Cuando agregamos estos valor juntos, obtenemos un total de frames que ingresamos a la base de datos. Recuerdas que el campo de 'Formato' pod\u00eda ya ser Puntuaci\u00f3n , Tiempo (Frames) , Tiempo (Milisegundos) o Valor ? Tiempo (Frames) es el mas com\u00fan de todos, y representa 'frames'. Time (Milisegundos) espera un valor que pueda convertir en milisegundos (Super Mario Kart utiliza esto). Sin embargo para convertir un valor en frames a un formato que sea humanamente entendible tenemos que dividir el valor por 60 para conseguir una interpretaci\u00f3n certera de los segundos, y un valor en milisegundos deber\u00eda estar dividido por 100 para conseguir el numero de milisegundos. Esto se utiliza ya sea en el sitio web y en los programas para mostrar el valor apropiadamente, y es importante que se distinga ya que podemos estar seguros que estamos consiguiendo el valor mas acertado del emulador, utilizando el formato que sea necesario para capturar el tiempo. Tambi\u00e9n hay un s\u00edmbolo que solamente funciona en este campo. Conecta dos valores condicionales con un $ y esto va a provocar que solamente se utilice el valor con tenga el valor mas alto. NOTA : Tiempo (Milisegundos) son actualmente centenas de segundo, no mil\u00e9simas de segundo. por ejemplo: un valor de 6234 deber\u00eda de ser 62.34 segundos, no 6.234 segundos. Tip : el modificador usa valores decimales, entonces si por ejemplo quieres divir entre dos, puedes multiplicar por 0.5: 0xhfe24*0.5 Ayuda Futura link Desafortunadamente hay MUCHAS maneras de llegar a hacer este proceso de la manera equivocada, entonces si llegas a tener alg\u00fan problema si\u00e9ntete libre de pedir ayuda en nuestro Servidor de Discord . Si quieres practicar, es bastante recomendable que crees tu tabla e intentes algo en un juego nuevo, en vez de utilizar una tabla ya existente. Por favor ten en cuenta que estos archivos son arrastrados directamente a la partida de alguien cuando abra el juego, y un valor de memoria mal ingresado o un comando puede causar que el emulador se crashee, as\u00ed que por favor testea el c\u00f3digo de tu tabla!

Las Notas est\u00e1n all\u00ed para ayudar en algunas de las condiciones que se encuentran aqu\u00ed abajo. Aqu\u00ed hay una breve explicaci\u00f3n de cada campo que se encuentra en una Tabla de Clasificacion: Titulo : El titulo de la tabla. Descripci\u00f3n : La descripci\u00f3n de la tabla. Formato : Puede llegar a ser Puntuaci\u00f3n , Tiempo (Frames) , Tiempo (Milisegundos) o Valor . Se utiliza para distinguir que tipo de tabla es (vamos a ver mas sobre esto mas abajo). \"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox : cuando se encuentra activada, significa que el valor mas bajo es mejor. Es usualmente el caso para logros basados en tiempo. Start : condiciones para empezar la tabla, aka STA . Cancel : condiciones para cancelar la tabla, aka CAN . Submit : condiciones para subir una entrada a la tabla, aka SUB . Value : valor que quieres que se suba a la tabla, aka VAL . Nota : Una tabla valida TIENE que tener todas estas cuatro condiciones. Esos \u00faltimos 4 campos son realmente importantes y se tiene que tomar MUCHO cuidado de acuerdo a los datos que vas a introducir en ellas. Es por eso que requieren una explicaci\u00f3n a continuaci\u00f3n: La condici\u00f3n STA o Start son una serie de valores, como un logro, que tienen que llegar a ser verdad en orden para que la tabla empieza a buscar una entrada para la tabla. Una vez que STA es verdadero, el juego va a activar las otras tres constantemente. Si la condici\u00f3n Cancel ( CAN ) es verdadera, entonces esta va a cancelar la tabla y no se va a subir la entrada a la misma. Si la condici\u00f3n Submit ( SUB ) es verdadera, entonces la puntuaci\u00f3n entrara en las tablas. NOTA: Cancel tiene mas prioridad que Submit. Si las dos se convierten verdaderas en el mismo frame, la puntuaci\u00f3n no sera ingresada. Finalmente, Value ( VAL ) es un caso especial, y va a ser tomado de la memoria utilizando la formula que se ingreso en la entrada de Value. Esta es la puntuaci\u00f3n que se muestra cuando la Tabla esta activa, y el valor que es ingresado en las tablas si SUB es verdadero. NOTA: Una vez que una tabla activa es cancelada o ingresada, esta no puede ser re-activada asta que la condici\u00f3n Start se convierta en falsa, y verdadera de nuevo. Esto previene a la tabla de ser re-activada inmediatamente que se ingreso un valor o se cancelo.","title":"Visiones Generales"},{"location":"Leaderboards-es/#formato-de-direcciones","text":"Las direcciones de memoria para STA/CAN/SUB/VAL tienen el siguiente formato: localizaci\u00f3n/tama\u00f1o prefijo (las letras pueden ser en min\u00fasculas) ejemplo bit0 0xM 0xM01234 bit1 0xN 0xN01234 bit2 0xO 0xO01234 bit3 0xP 0xP01234 bit4 0xQ 0xQ01234 bit5 0xR 0xR01234 bit6 0xS 0xS01234 bit7 0xT 0xT01234 Lower4 0xL 0xL01234 Upper4 0xU 0xU01234 8bit 0xH 0xH01234 16bit 0x 0x01234 32bit 0xX 0xX01234","title":"Formato de Direcciones"},{"location":"Leaderboards-es/#ejemplo","text":"La mejor manera de empezar es hecharle un vistazo a una de las tablas ya existentes https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardList.php y abrirla para ver como funciona.

En Sonic cada 60 frames es un 1 segundo, entonces vamos a monitoriar los segundo utilizando frames. La caja de Lower Is Better esta marcada, entonces aquel que consiga el tiempo mas corto sera el #1.

Esto puede parecer desalentador, porque no sabes que significan esta direcciones. Es por eso que las Notas de C\u00f3digo en la columna de la derecha son bastante \u00fatiles! Tu puedes llegar a ver como estas direcciones son mostradas en memoria. En nuestro ejemplo tenemos: 0xfe10 es el nivel, y se espera que sea 0 (el primer nivel). 0xf601 es una direccion en memoria de 8-bit, y utilizamos el prefijo 0xh en vez de 0x . 0xf601 es el modo de la pantalla. La segunda y terceras partes de las condiciones para empezar estan diciendo \"el modo actual tiene que ser ingame ( 0c ), y el modo en el frame anterior NO tiene que ser ingame \". Nota : ese prefijo d en la direcci\u00f3n representa delta, o \"el valor en el frame anterior\". Sum\u00e1ndole a esto: ejecuta STA si ACABAMOS de llegar a un nivel, (para empezar a checar el tiempo). Finalmente tambi\u00e9n esperamos que 0xfff0 sea equivalente a 0 , ya que esta direcci\u00f3n se utiliza para demo mode, y no queremos que la tabla se active cuando esta el modo demo activado! Tip : el error mas com\u00fan cuando creamos tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n es olvidarnos de la h cuando tratamos de hacer referencia a un valor en memoria de 8-bit. Pro-tip: STA , CAN , y SUB soportan toda la logica que se encuentra disponible en el editor de logros . La manera mas facil es asegurarte que escribiste todo correctamente es crear logros locales que capturen estos eventos, y entonces extraer los valores ingresados en el archivo \"XXX-User.txt\" asociado al juego en el cual te encuentras trabajando.","title":"Condiciones de Start"},{"location":"Leaderboards-es/#condiciones-para-cancelar","text":"CAN : 0xhfe13<d0xhfe13 0xfe13 es el numero de vidas.

Queremos hacer esto porque puedes llegar al ultimo checkpoint, morir y resetear tu tiempo a 0:00. Y no queremos que se pueda hacer esto, ya que no es la manera correcta de completar el nivel. As\u00ed que si el jugador muere, se va a resetear el progreso de la tabla.

Una vez que el jugador a llegado a la condici\u00f3n de inicio, se mostrara una notificaci\u00f3n en pantalla, mostrando el progreso del jugador en tiempo real. Si es una una tabla sobre tiempo, va a ver un reloj, y si es una puntuaci\u00f3n se mostrara simplemente el valor. Si ellos llegan a cumplir la condici\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n, se mostrara un mensaje diciendo que fallaron, y la notificaci\u00f3n sera removida. Si ellos cumplen la condici\u00f3n de submit exitosamente, el valor actual se va a tomar y se va a subir una entrada, aparecer\u00e1 una notificaci\u00f3n informando al jugador sobre su posici\u00f3n en las tablas. La condiciones en value son especiales en cierto aspectos. Es evaluada constantemente y se muestra en pantalla en tiempo real cuando una tabla esta activada. No trabaja como otras condiciones, interpreta las direcciones de la siguiente manera: direcci\u00f3n*modificador (direcci\u00f3n veces modificador) y usa al _ operador guion bajo como 'mas'. El asterisco * significa 'multiplicar', entonces en el valor 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 representa: 8-bit 0xfe24 1 vez, MAS 8-bit 0xfe25 60 veces, MAS 8-bit 0xfe22 3600 veces La raz\u00f3n de esto es que los valores de cada una de estas direcciones significan frames, segundos, y minutos respectivamente. Cuando agregamos estos valor juntos, obtenemos un total de frames que ingresamos a la base de datos. Recuerdas que el campo de 'Formato' pod\u00eda ya ser Puntuaci\u00f3n , Tiempo (Frames) , Tiempo (Milisegundos) o Valor ? Tiempo (Frames) es el mas com\u00fan de todos, y representa 'frames'. Time (Milisegundos) espera un valor que pueda convertir en milisegundos (Super Mario Kart utiliza esto). Sin embargo para convertir un valor en frames a un formato que sea humanamente entendible tenemos que dividir el valor por 60 para conseguir una interpretaci\u00f3n certera de los segundos, y un valor en milisegundos deber\u00eda estar dividido por 100 para conseguir el numero de milisegundos. Esto se utiliza ya sea en el sitio web y en los programas para mostrar el valor apropiadamente, y es importante que se distinga ya que podemos estar seguros que estamos consiguiendo el valor mas acertado del emulador, utilizando el formato que sea necesario para capturar el tiempo. Tambi\u00e9n hay un s\u00edmbolo que solamente funciona en este campo. Conecta dos valores condicionales con un $ y esto va a provocar que solamente se utilice el valor con tenga el valor mas alto. NOTA : Tiempo (Milisegundos) son actualmente centenas de segundo, no mil\u00e9simas de segundo. por ejemplo: un valor de 6234 deber\u00eda de ser 62.34 segundos, no 6.234 segundos. Tip : el modificador usa valores decimales, entonces si por ejemplo quieres divir entre dos, puedes multiplicar por 0.5: 0xhfe24*0.5","title":"Interpretador de Valores"},{"location":"Leaderboards-es/#ayuda-futura","text":"Desafortunadamente hay MUCHAS maneras de llegar a hacer este proceso de la manera equivocada, entonces si llegas a tener alg\u00fan problema si\u00e9ntete libre de pedir ayuda en nuestro Servidor de Discord .

O Type \u00e9 \"Time (Frame)\". Em Sonic cada 60 frames equivale a 1 segundo, ent\u00e3o vamos monitorar o tempo usando os frames. A checkbox Lower Is Better est\u00e1 marcada, entao aquele que fizer o tempo mais curto ser\u00e1 o #1. Agora nos vamos explicar as partes mais importantes. Condi\u00e7\u00f5es de In\u00edcio link STA : 0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0 0xfe10=h0000 : Se o endere\u00e7o da RAM 0xfe10 \u00e9 equivalente hex 0000, _ : E, 0xhf601=h0c : Se o endere\u00e7o da RAM 8-bits 0xf601 \u00e9 equivalente para hex 0c, _ : E, d0xhf601!=h0c : Se o endere\u00e7o da RAM 8-bits anterior 0xf601 N\u00c3O \u00e9 equivalente ao 0c, _ : E, 0xfff0=0 Se o endere\u00e7o da RAM 0xfff0 \u00e9 equivalente ao 0. Esto parece ser intimidador, porque nos n\u00e3o sabemos o que esse endere\u00e7o diz. \u00c9 por isso que o Code Note na coluna direita \u00e9 de bastante ajuda! Voc\u00ea pode ser como esses endere\u00e7os est\u00e3o classificados na mem\u00f3ria. Em nosso exemplo nos temos: 0xfe10 \u00e9 o nivel, e espera-se que seja 0 (o primeiro nivel). 0xf601 \u00e9 um endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria de 8 bits, e nos usamos o prefixo 0xh em vez de 0x para significar isso. 0xf601 \u00e9 o modo de tela. A segunda e a terceira parte desta Condi\u00e7\u00e3o de In\u00edcio est\u00e1 dizendo \"o modo atual deve ser ingame ( 0c ), e o modo no frame anterior N\u00c3O deve ser ingame \". Nota : O prefixo \"d\" no endere\u00e7o representa delta, ou \"o valor do frame anterior\". Resumindo : ative o leaderboard imediatamente ap\u00f3s iniciar uma fase (a partir da\u00ed vamos come\u00e7ar a medir o tempo). Finalmente n\u00f3s al\u00e9m de esperar que 0xfff0 seja aquivalente a 0 , porque 0xfff0 \u00e9 o modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00f3s n\u00e3o queremos enviar pontua\u00e7\u00f5es para a leaderboard quando a demo estiver ativa! Condi\u00e7\u00f5es de Cancelamento link CAN : 0xhfe13<d0xhfe13 0xfe13 \u00e9 o numero de vidas. A se\u00e7\u00e3o de cancelamento checa se o contador de VIDAS do jogador se tormar menor. Literalmente, isto diz \"Cancela se o ATUAL valor em 0xfe13 \u00e9 menor que o valor ANTERIOR em 0xfe13. N\u00f3s queremos que fa\u00e7a isso porque voce pode alcan\u00e7ar o checkpoint final e correr fora do tempo, resetando seu contador para 0:00. Nos n\u00e3o queremos permitir isso, porque isto n\u00e3o \u00e9 a forma correta de completar o nivel. Ent\u00e3o, se o jogardor morrer, n\u00f3s resetamos o progresso do leaderboard dele. Condi\u00e7\u00f5es de envio link SUB : 0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0 0xf7cc isto \u00e9 a bandeira de final de fase, n\u00e3o-interativo. A se\u00e7\u00e3o de envio checa se o frame atual tem o marcador de 'endlevel' (fim de fase) for para verdadeiro (ou !=0 , 'naozero'), e o frame anterior (delta) tem isto para ser falso (ou =0 , 'zero'). Isto sugere que o jogador chegou ao fim do nivel, e provou ser um benchmark bastante robusto Dica : isto pode ser \u00fatil para observar estes valores na mem\u00f3ria para ver como eles executam, e que tipo de valores eles terminam em diferentes circunst\u00e2ncias. Interpretador de Valores link VAL : 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 Finalmente, valores. Uma vez que o jogador chegou ao inicio da condi\u00e7\u00e3o, eles ir\u00e3o ser mostrados em uma caixa quue permanece na tela, aparecendo o progresso deles at\u00e9 agora. Se \u00e9 uma leaderboard de tempo, ser\u00e1 um rel\u00f3gio, e se for uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o, ser\u00e1 apenas o valor. Se eles cumprirem a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de cancelamento, eles ser\u00e3o informados de que eles falharam, e o pop-up ser\u00e1 removido. Se caso o jogador chegar com sucesso \u00e0 condi\u00e7\u00e3o de envio, o valor atual ser\u00e1 pego e submetido como pontua\u00e7\u00e3o. o pop-up ingame ir\u00e1 informar o jogador o t\u00e3o longe da leaderboard, e a posi\u00e7\u00e3o deles na leaderboard. A condi\u00e7\u00e3o de valor \u00e9 especial em poucas maneiras. Ele \u00e9 avaliado constantemente e exibido na tela o tempo todo quando a leaderboard est\u00e1 ativa. Isto n\u00e3o funciona como as outras condi\u00e7\u00f5es. Isto espera endere\u00e7os da seguinte maneira: endere\u00e7o*modificador (endere\u00e7o tempo modificador) e usa o _ sublinhado como um 'plus'. O * asterisco significa 'm\u00faltiplo', ent\u00e3o no valor 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 representa: 8-bit 0xfe24 vezes 1, MAIS 8-bit 0xfe25 vezes 60, MAIS 8-bit 0xfe22 vezes 3600 A raz\u00e3o para isso \u00e9 que os valores em cada um desses endere\u00e7os significam frames, segundos e minutos respectivamentes. Quando nos adicionamos esses valores juntos, n\u00f3s conseguimos um grande total em frames que vamos enviar para o \"Banco de dados\". Lembre que o campo 'Formato' pode ser Pontua\u00e7\u00e3o , Tempo (Frames) , Tempo (Milisegundos) ou Valor . Tempo(Frames) \u00e9 o mais comum, e representa 'frames'. Tempo (Milisegundos) espera um valor que nos podemos converter diretamente para milisegundos. (Super Mario Kart usa isso). No entanto, para converter um valor em frame dentro de um formato \"para ser lidos por humanos\", nos devemos dividiu o valor por 60 para uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o de segundos correta, e um valor em milisegundos deve ser dividido por 100 para conseguir o numero de segundos. Isso \u00e9 usado no site e no aplicativo para exibir o valor apropriadamente, e \u00e9 importante para distinguir, para que possamos ter certeza de obter o valor mais preciso do emulador, usando qualquer formato que eles usem para registrar o tempo.

It's a pretty hefty interface and a difficult job to get a leaderboard working just right. It genuinely takes some care and attention to get a good leaderboard working, so in this doc we'll try to understand how it works. Overview link This is how a game's Leaderboard List looks like on the website: In the center you can see every already made Leaderboard, and in the right column you can see the Code Notes for the game. The Code Notes are here to help with some conditions we'll see below. Here's a brief explanation of each field of a single Leaderboard: Title : the leaderboard's title. Description : the leaderboard's description. Format : it can be Score , Time (Frames) , Time (Milliseconds) or Value . It's used to distinguish what sort of leaderboard this is (we'll go into this below). \"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox : when checked, it means that a lower value is a better thing. It's usually the case for time based leaderboards, whereas a larger score generally is better. Start : start conditions, aka STA . Cancel : cancel conditions, aka CAN . Submit : submit conditions, aka SUB . Value : a value interpreter, aka VAL . Note : A valid leaderboard MUST have all four of these conditions. Those last 4 fields are really important and LOTS of care must be taken over the entry of any characters into these strings. That's why they deserve a further explanation: The Start ( STA ) condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. If a Cancel ( CAN ) condition is true, then it will cancel the leaderboard and no score will be submitted. NOTE: Cancel is given priority over Start. If both become true in the same frame, the leaderboard will not start. If the Submit ( SUB ) condition is true, then the leaderboard score will be submitted. NOTE: Cancel is given priority over Submit. If both become true in the same frame, the score will not be submitted. Finally, the Value ( VAL ) is a special case, and will be taken from memory using the formula stated in the memory box. This is the score that gets displayed while the leaderboard is active, and the value that's submitted if SUB is true. NOTE: Once an active leaderboard is cancelled or submitted, it cannot be reactivated until the Start condition becomes false, then true again. This prevents the leaderboard from immediately reactivating after submission/cancel. Address Format link The memory addresses for STA/CAN/SUB/VAL have the following format: location/size prefix (the letters can be in lower case) example bit0 0xM 0xM01234 bit1 0xN 0xN01234 bit2 0xO 0xO01234 bit3 0xP 0xP01234 bit4 0xQ 0xQ01234 bit5 0xR 0xR01234 bit6 0xS 0xS01234 bit7 0xT 0xT01234 Lower4 0xL 0xL01234 Upper4 0xU 0xU01234 8bit 0xH 0xH01234 16bit 0x 0x01234 24bit 0xW 0xW01234 32bit 0xX 0xX01234 Example link The best place to start is to look at one of the existing leaderboards https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardList.php and break it down to see how it works. We're going to use the Green Hill Act 1 (Sonic the Hedgehog) Leaderboard for this purpose. Then let's see how it looks: The Title/Description fields are quite obvious. The Type is \"Time (Frames)\". In Sonic every 60 frames is 1 second, then we'll monitor the time using the frames. The Lower Is Better flag is checked, then the one who makes the shortest time will be the #1. Now we're going to break down the most important parts. Start Conditions link STA : 0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0 0xfe10=h0000 : If 16-bit RAM address 0xfe10 is equivalent to hex 0000, _ : AND, 0xhf601=h0c : If 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is equivalent to hex 0c, _ : AND, d0xhf601!=h0c : If the previous 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is NOT equivalent to hex 0c, _ : AND, 0xfff0=0 If 16-bit RAM address 0xfff0 is equivalent to 0. This might seem daunting, because we don't know what these addresses mean. That's why the Code Notes in the right column are pretty handy! You can see how these addresses are labelled in memory. In our example we have: 0xfe10 is the level, and is expected to be 0 (the first level). 0xf601 is an 8-bit memory address, and we use the prefix 0xh instead of 0x to signify this. The 0xf601 is the screen mode. The second and third parts of the start statement are saying \"the current mode should be ingame ( 0c ), and the mode on the previous frame should NOT be ingame \". Note : that d prefix on the address represents delta, or \"the previous frame's value\". Summing up: trigger this if we've JUST arrived in a level (the start of the level, when we want to start testing their time). Finally we also expect 0xfff0 to be equivalent to 0 , because this address is used for demo mode, and we don't want to award a leaderboard entry when the demo is active! Tip : the most common mistake when creating leaderboards is forgetting the h when trying to reference an 8-bit memory address. Pro-tip: STA , CAN , and SUB support all logic available in the achievement editor . The easiest way to make sure you get them written correctly is to create local achievements that capture the events, then extract the serialized values from the \"XXX-User.txt\" file associated to the game you're working on. Note : You can use HitCounts in the Start/Submit/Cancel triggers, but you are responsible for resetting them. These triggers are evaluated every frame, and the state of the leaderboard is dependent on which ones are true. As such, the HitCount will increment even when the leaderboard is not active unless you have an explicit ResetIf condition. Cancel Conditions link CAN : 0xhfe13<d0xhfe13 0xfe13 is the number of lives. The cancel section checks if the player's LIVES counter ever becomes lower. Literally, it says \"Cancel if the CURRENT value at 0xfe13 is less than the PREVIOUS value at 0xfe13\". We want to do this because you could reach the final checkpoint and run out of time, resetting your timer to 0:00. We don't want to allow this, because it's not the correct way of completing the level. So if the player dies, we reset their leaderboard progress. Finally, if you connect two cancel conditions with s , the leaderboard will cancel when either one of them are true. Submit Conditions link SUB : 0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0 0xf7cc is the endlevel flag, non-interactive. The submit section checks if the current frame has the 'endlevel' flag set to true (or !=0 , 'nonzero'), and the previous frame (delta) has it set to false (or =0 , 'zero'). This suggests that the player has reached the end of the level, and has proven to be a fairly sturdy benchmark. Tip : it can be useful to watch these values in memory to see how they perform, and what sort of values they end up at in different circumstances. Value Interpreter link See also: Binary Coded Decimal VAL : 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 Finally, value. Once the player has reached the start condition, they will be shown a popup which remains on-screen, showing their progress so far. If it's a time leaderboard, it will be a clock, and if it's a score, it will just be the value. If they fulfill the cancel condition, they will be told that they have failed, and the popup will be removed. If they successfully reach the submit condition, the current value will be taken and submitted as their score, and on successful submission, an ingame popup will inform the player of the leaderboard so far, and their position in the leaderboard. The value condition is special in a few ways. It is evaluated constantly and shown on-screen all the time when the leaderboard is active. It doesn't work like the other conditions, it expects addresses in the following way: address*modifier (address times modifier) and it uses the _ underscore operator as a 'plus'. The * asterisk signifies 'multiply', so in the value 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 represents: 8-bit 0xfe24 times 1, PLUS 8-bit 0xfe25 times 60, PLUS 8-bit 0xfe22 times 3600 The reason for this is that the values in each of these addresses signifies frames, seconds, and minutes respectively. When we add these values together, we get a grand total in frames that we submit to the database. Remember that 'Format' field that can be either Score , Time (Frames) , Time (Milliseconds) or Value ? Time (Frames) is the most common one, and represents 'frames'. Time (Milliseconds) expects a value that we can convert directly into millisecs (Super Mario Kart uses this). However to convert a value in frames into a human-readible format, we should divide the value by 60 to get an accurate representation of seconds, and a value in millisecs should be divided by 100 to get the number of seconds. This is used both on the website and in the app to display the value properly, and is important to distinguish so we can be sure we get the most accurate value out of the emulator, by using whatever format they use to record time. There is also a symbol which only works in this field. Connecting two value conditions with $ will cause only the one with the highest value to be used. NOTE : The value calculation is performed using 32-bit signed integers. As such, the maximum value is 2147483647 and the minimum value is -2147483648. Values above the maximum will wrap around and register as very negative numbers. NOTE : Time (Milliseconds) is actually hundredths of a second, not thousandths of a second. i.e. a Value of 6234 would be 62.34 seconds, not 6.234 seconds. Tip : modifier is a decimal value, so if you need to divide by two, you can multiply by 0.5: 0xhfe24*0.5 Value from HitCount link Starting with the 0.77 DLL (and RetroArch 1.8.2), you can use the Measured flag to count the number of times something happens and submit that as the value. To do so, your Value field should look like a trigger that only has one Measured condition. You can use AddHits, AddSource, SubSource, AddAddress, and AndNext in conditions leading up to the Measured condition for more complex measurements. The HitCount on the condition will automatically be set to 0 when the leaderboard starts, and the HitCount will be submitted as the Value when the leaderboard submit trigger activates. Do not include an explicit Hit target, or that will be the maximum value that can be submitted. For example: M:0xH1234!=d0xH1234 Would submit the number of times the byte at $1234 changed while the leaderboard was active. N:0xH1234!=20_M:0xH1234!=d0xH1234 Would submit the number of times the byte at $1234 changed to something other than 20 while the leaderboard was active. Since this is trigger syntax, you cannot use multiplication or any of the other value-specific flags mentioned in the previous section. Further help link There are unfortunately MANY ways to get this process wrong, so if you are having any trouble feel free to ask for help in our Discord server . If you want to practice, it's highly recommended to create your own leaderboard and attempting something on a new game, rather than using an existing leaderboard. Please remember that these files are pulled directly into someone's game if they decide to play it, and a badly formed memory address or string could cause their emulator to crash, so please test your leaderboard code!

That's why they deserve a further explanation: The Start ( STA ) condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. If a Cancel ( CAN ) condition is true, then it will cancel the leaderboard and no score will be submitted. NOTE: Cancel is given priority over Start. If both become true in the same frame, the leaderboard will not start. If the Submit ( SUB ) condition is true, then the leaderboard score will be submitted. NOTE: Cancel is given priority over Submit. If both become true in the same frame, the score will not be submitted. Finally, the Value ( VAL ) is a special case, and will be taken from memory using the formula stated in the memory box. This is the score that gets displayed while the leaderboard is active, and the value that's submitted if SUB is true. NOTE: Once an active leaderboard is cancelled or submitted, it cannot be reactivated until the Start condition becomes false, then true again. This prevents the leaderboard from immediately reactivating after submission/cancel.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Leaderboards/#address-format","text":"The memory addresses for STA/CAN/SUB/VAL have the following format: location/size prefix (the letters can be in lower case) example bit0 0xM 0xM01234 bit1 0xN 0xN01234 bit2 0xO 0xO01234 bit3 0xP 0xP01234 bit4 0xQ 0xQ01234 bit5 0xR 0xR01234 bit6 0xS 0xS01234 bit7 0xT 0xT01234 Lower4 0xL 0xL01234 Upper4 0xU 0xU01234 8bit 0xH 0xH01234 16bit 0x 0x01234 24bit 0xW 0xW01234 32bit 0xX 0xX01234","title":"Address Format"},{"location":"Leaderboards/#example","text":"The best place to start is to look at one of the existing leaderboards https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardList.php and break it down to see how it works. We're going to use the Green Hill Act 1 (Sonic the Hedgehog) Leaderboard for this purpose. Then let's see how it looks: The Title/Description fields are quite obvious. The Type is \"Time (Frames)\". In Sonic every 60 frames is 1 second, then we'll monitor the time using the frames. The Lower Is Better flag is checked, then the one who makes the shortest time will be the #1. Now we're going to break down the most important parts.","title":"Example"},{"location":"Leaderboards/#start-conditions","text":"STA : 0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0 0xfe10=h0000 : If 16-bit RAM address 0xfe10 is equivalent to hex 0000, _ : AND, 0xhf601=h0c : If 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is equivalent to hex 0c, _ : AND, d0xhf601!=h0c : If the previous 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is NOT equivalent to hex 0c, _ : AND, 0xfff0=0 If 16-bit RAM address 0xfff0 is equivalent to 0. This might seem daunting, because we don't know what these addresses mean. That's why the Code Notes in the right column are pretty handy! You can see how these addresses are labelled in memory. In our example we have: 0xfe10 is the level, and is expected to be 0 (the first level). 0xf601 is an 8-bit memory address, and we use the prefix 0xh instead of 0x to signify this. The 0xf601 is the screen mode. The second and third parts of the start statement are saying \"the current mode should be ingame ( 0c ), and the mode on the previous frame should NOT be ingame \". Note : that d prefix on the address represents delta, or \"the previous frame's value\". Summing up: trigger this if we've JUST arrived in a level (the start of the level, when we want to start testing their time). Finally we also expect 0xfff0 to be equivalent to 0 , because this address is used for demo mode, and we don't want to award a leaderboard entry when the demo is active! Tip : the most common mistake when creating leaderboards is forgetting the h when trying to reference an 8-bit memory address. Pro-tip: STA , CAN , and SUB support all logic available in the achievement editor . The easiest way to make sure you get them written correctly is to create local achievements that capture the events, then extract the serialized values from the \"XXX-User.txt\" file associated to the game you're working on. Note : You can use HitCounts in the Start/Submit/Cancel triggers, but you are responsible for resetting them. These triggers are evaluated every frame, and the state of the leaderboard is dependent on which ones are true. As such, the HitCount will increment even when the leaderboard is not active unless you have an explicit ResetIf condition.","title":"Start Conditions"},{"location":"Leaderboards/#cancel-conditions","text":"CAN : 0xhfe13<d0xhfe13 0xfe13 is the number of lives. The cancel section checks if the player's LIVES counter ever becomes lower. Literally, it says \"Cancel if the CURRENT value at 0xfe13 is less than the PREVIOUS value at 0xfe13\". We want to do this because you could reach the final checkpoint and run out of time, resetting your timer to 0:00. We don't want to allow this, because it's not the correct way of completing the level. So if the player dies, we reset their leaderboard progress. Finally, if you connect two cancel conditions with s , the leaderboard will cancel when either one of them are true.","title":"Cancel Conditions"},{"location":"Leaderboards/#submit-conditions","text":"SUB : 0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0 0xf7cc is the endlevel flag, non-interactive. The submit section checks if the current frame has the 'endlevel' flag set to true (or !=0 , 'nonzero'), and the previous frame (delta) has it set to false (or =0 , 'zero'). This suggests that the player has reached the end of the level, and has proven to be a fairly sturdy benchmark. Tip : it can be useful to watch these values in memory to see how they perform, and what sort of values they end up at in different circumstances.","title":"Submit Conditions"},{"location":"Leaderboards/#value-interpreter","text":"See also: Binary Coded Decimal VAL : 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 Finally, value. Once the player has reached the start condition, they will be shown a popup which remains on-screen, showing their progress so far. If it's a time leaderboard, it will be a clock, and if it's a score, it will just be the value. If they fulfill the cancel condition, they will be told that they have failed, and the popup will be removed. If they successfully reach the submit condition, the current value will be taken and submitted as their score, and on successful submission, an ingame popup will inform the player of the leaderboard so far, and their position in the leaderboard. The value condition is special in a few ways. It is evaluated constantly and shown on-screen all the time when the leaderboard is active. It doesn't work like the other conditions, it expects addresses in the following way: address*modifier (address times modifier) and it uses the _ underscore operator as a 'plus'. The * asterisk signifies 'multiply', so in the value 0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600 represents: 8-bit 0xfe24 times 1, PLUS 8-bit 0xfe25 times 60, PLUS 8-bit 0xfe22 times 3600 The reason for this is that the values in each of these addresses signifies frames, seconds, and minutes respectively. When we add these values together, we get a grand total in frames that we submit to the database. Remember that 'Format' field that can be either Score , Time (Frames) , Time (Milliseconds) or Value ? Time (Frames) is the most common one, and represents 'frames'. Time (Milliseconds) expects a value that we can convert directly into millisecs (Super Mario Kart uses this). However to convert a value in frames into a human-readible format, we should divide the value by 60 to get an accurate representation of seconds, and a value in millisecs should be divided by 100 to get the number of seconds. This is used both on the website and in the app to display the value properly, and is important to distinguish so we can be sure we get the most accurate value out of the emulator, by using whatever format they use to record time. There is also a symbol which only works in this field. Connecting two value conditions with $ will cause only the one with the highest value to be used. NOTE : The value calculation is performed using 32-bit signed integers. As such, the maximum value is 2147483647 and the minimum value is -2147483648. Values above the maximum will wrap around and register as very negative numbers. NOTE : Time (Milliseconds) is actually hundredths of a second, not thousandths of a second. i.e. a Value of 6234 would be 62.34 seconds, not 6.234 seconds. Tip : modifier is a decimal value, so if you need to divide by two, you can multiply by 0.5: 0xhfe24*0.5","title":"Value Interpreter"},{"location":"Leaderboards/#value-from-hitcount","text":"Starting with the 0.77 DLL (and RetroArch 1.8.2), you can use the Measured flag to count the number of times something happens and submit that as the value. To do so, your Value field should look like a trigger that only has one Measured condition. You can use AddHits, AddSource, SubSource, AddAddress, and AndNext in conditions leading up to the Measured condition for more complex measurements. The HitCount on the condition will automatically be set to 0 when the leaderboard starts, and the HitCount will be submitted as the Value when the leaderboard submit trigger activates. Do not include an explicit Hit target, or that will be the maximum value that can be submitted. For example: M:0xH1234!=d0xH1234 Would submit the number of times the byte at $1234 changed while the leaderboard was active. N:0xH1234!=20_M:0xH1234!=d0xH1234 Would submit the number of times the byte at $1234 changed to something other than 20 while the leaderboard was active.

It adds a progress bar to the achievement overlay to inform the user how close they are to completing an achievement. As the user expects an achievement to trigger when the progress bar is full, it is expected that any other conditions in the achievement should be true most of the time. If placed on a condition with a required HitCount , the target value is the required HitCount and the current value is the current HitCount. AddHits can be used. If placed on a condition without a HitCount, the target value is the constant on the right side of the condition and the current value is the evaluation of the left side of the condition. AddSource and SubSource can be used. If multiple conditions are marked as Measured and have the same target value, the current value will be the maximum of all the Measured conditions. If multiple conditions are marked as Measured and have different target values, a Parse Error -22 will occur. Note that progress for Measured values is reported at the time of examination and may actually go down depending on the current value (Hit Count could be reset, or comparison value decreases). To limit the scope of a Measured condition, you can add a MeasuredIf condition. A MeasuredIf condition must be true for the Measured value to be non-zero (and for the achievement to trigger). You can use MeasuredIf to create achievements that require playing as a certain character, or just to prevent bogus data from showing up if the player is in the wrong part of the game. If any MeasuredIf condition in a group is false, the Measured value for the group is automatically 0.

Leyendo informacion en el Visor de Memoria link Notaciones Decimales, Binarias y Hexadecimales link Para trabajar bien con el Visor de Memoria, es importante entender minimo lo basico de los numeros binarios y hexadecimal. Aqui hay algunos recursos de informacion sobre este tema sin irnos a detalles muy extremos: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_binario https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_hexadecimal Los digitos utilizados en el sistema binario son 0 y 1 . Un digito binario tambien es conocido como un bit . Ocho bits tambien se le conocen como un byte . Los digitos utilizados en el sistema hexadecimal son 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , A , B , C , D , E y F . La notacion hexadecimal tambien se le conoce como hex . La razon principal para estas 2 notaciones, mas alla del sistema decimal tradicional, son: Notacion Decimal es lo que los humanos entienden. Notacion Binaria es lo que las computadoras \"entienden\". Notacion Hexadecimal se puede llegar a ver como un punto medio entre la binaria y la decimal. Porque un solo digito hexadecimal representa 4 bits, entonces es una notacion mas corta y entendible con la que pueden trabajar los humanos y las computadoras tambien pueden \"entender\". La siguiente table muestra las direntes notacion para sus valores equivalentes. Decimal Hexadecimal Binario 0 0x0 0000 1 0x1 0001 2 0x2 0010 3 0x3 0011 4 0x4 0100 5 0x5 0101 6 0x6 0110 7 0x7 0111 8 0x8 1000 9 0x9 1001 10 0xA 1010 11 0xB 1011 12 0xC 1100 13 0xD 1101 14 0xE 1110 15 0xF 1111 Mas datos sobre las diferentes notaciones: Para indicar que un valor esta escrito en hexadecimal, se utiliza el prefijo 0x : 0x10 = 16 , 10 = 10 . Dos digitos hex representan 8 bits y tienen un rango entre 0 y 255 . Cuatro digitos hex representan 16 bits y tienen un rango entre 0 y 65535 . Ocho digitos hex representan 32 bits y tienen un rango entre 0 y 4294967295 . Modos en el visor de Memoria link La parte de hasta abajo del Inspector de Memoria es lo que llamamos visor de Memoria: Puedes ver la informacion en el Visor de Memoria utilizando los modos 8, 16 y 32-bit. Modo 8-bit link Por defecto, el Visor de Memoria muestra la informacion en modo de 8-bit. Esto muestra cada byte de memoria como un valor de dos-caracteres hexadecimales por separado. Cada byte tiene su propia direccion. Dieciseis bytes son mostrados por linea. La direccion de un byte se puede determinar a\u00f1adiendo la posicion de la fila (mostrada a la izquierda del vizor) a la posicion de la columna (mostrada arriba del visor). Usando la imagen de arriba como un ejemplo, el cursor esta en 0x002a7 ( 0x002a0 + 7 ). Modo 16/32-bit link Antes de que hables del modo de 16-bit mode y 32-bit, es importante saber sobre el endianness (extremidad): Endianness link Se describe como Endianness el orden en el que una secuencia de bytes se encuentra almacenada en memoria de una computadora. Los dos tipos mas comunes son: Big-Endian (tambien conocido como BE) y Little-Endian (tambien conocido como LE). En el orden Big-Endian la \"big end\" (extremidad) de un numero (el valor mas significativo en secuencia) es almacenado primero (posicionado en la direccion mas peque\u00f1a). En la imagen de abajo puedes ver el numero 0x12345678 almacenado en la direccion 0x100 en el sistema big-endian. Ten en cuenta que el byte mas significativo 0x12 se encunetra en la direccion 0x100 : En el orden Little-Endian el \"little end\" (extremidad) de un numero (el valor menos significativo en secuencia) es almacenado primero (posicionado en la direccion mas grande). En la imagen de abajo puedes ver el numero 0x12345678 almacenado en la direccion 0x100 en orden little-endian. Ten en cuenta que el byte menos significativo 0x78 se encuentra en la direccion 0x100 : Valores que necesitan mas de 8-bits (en otras palabras: mas grandes que 255) necesitan estar almacenado en multiples bytes. Inclusive, los sistemas emulados que utilizamos almacenan valores de multiples-bytes en orden little-endian. En la imagen del Visor de Memoria de arriba puedes ver que en la direccion 0x0002c0 tenemos el valor hexadecimal ce y en 0x0002c1 el valor es 39 . Cuando cambias el visor a modo de 16-bit, los valores ce y 39 se agrupan en 0x0002c0 y son mostrados como 39ce . Esto pasa porque automaticamente agrupa cada dos bytes y los muestra como valos hexadecimales de 16-bit. NOTA : Mientras que los valores de 16-bits se alinean generalmente a direcciones pares, este no siempre es el caso. De hecho hay un valor de 16-bit que no se muestra en 0x0002c1 . Ya que el valor en 0x0002c1 es 39 y el valor en 0x0002c2 es 29 , el valor de 16-bit value en la direccion 0x0002c1 es 0x2939 . Similarmente en, el modo de 32-bit, los cuatro bytes de 0x0002c0 a 0x0002c3 se muestran como un solo valor de 32-bit 0x252939ce en la direccion 0x0002c0 , pero tambien hay valores de 32-bit en 0x0002c1 , 0x0002c2 , and 0x0002c3 . Trabajando con tama\u00f1os inferiores a 8-bit link En addicion al 8-bit, 16-bit y 32-bit los tama\u00f1os descritos arriba, existen tama\u00f1os adicionales que pueden ser utilizados al momentos que estemos creando logros (en el editor de Logros (Achievement Editor)). Single bits link En el visor de memoria cuando un valor de 8-bit es seleccionado vas a ver algo como la imagen de abajo (en la imagen: un byte con valor 6f es seleccionado; los bits estan resaltados con un circulo naranja): Es muy comun almacenar informacion importante en un solo bit. Ya que un bit solo puede tener dos posibles valores ( 1 o 0 ), algunas veces se utiliza para significarn \"si\" o \"no\", \"encendido\" o \"apagado\", \"tiene un item\" o \"no item\", etc. Algunos juegos, especialmente aquellos que tienen espacio muy limitado en memoria, utilizan bit como botones bastante. Importante: Puedes referirte a cada uno de esos bits indidualmente en el Editor de Logros (Achievement Editor). Significados mas comunes de botones de bit en la memoria de un juego: tienes un item boton presionado (muy comun) area explorada secuencia del juego activated cheat activado modo demo activo En el visor de memoria solo puedes ingresar valores hex, entonces es importante conocer la importancia entre valores con notacion hexadecimal y binaria. Puedes ver en la tabla de \" Notaciones Decimales, Binarias y Hexadecimales \" , pero lo usual es usar una calculadora (la calculadora default de MS Windows en modo programador puede hacer el trabajo) Upper4 y Lower4 link Upper4 son los cuatro bits superiores de un byte (bit: 7, 6, 5, 4), mostrados como un solo caracter hexadecimal. Lower4 son los cuatro bits inferiores de un byte (bit: 3, 2, 1, 0), mostrados como un solo caracter hexadecimal. Observando el diagrama de tama\u00f1o de memoria de abajo, un byte en la direccion 0x00a274 es seleccionado (valor 0x23 ). El primer caracter, 2 es el valor Upper4. El segundo characterr 3 es el valor Lower4. Ocasionalmente solo vas a estar interesado en trabajar con solo un digito hexadecimal. Utilizando el diagrama de tama\u00f1o de memoria como un ejemplo, como una condicion de un logro donde Upper4 0x00a274 = 0x2 seria verdadera. Una condicion donde Lower4 0x00a274 = 0x3 seria verdadera.

Esto es util para cosas como vida o consumibles. Congelar variables puede ser manipulado directamente desde el inspector. Ten en mente que, el congelamiento ocurre 1 frame despues del gameplay. Esto significa que incluso cuando este congelada, el valor no va a cambiar al menos que pase un frame para que pueda congelarse la variable. Esto siempre se va a mostrar como amarillo.","title":"8.

This tool can be found on \"RetroAchievements\" menu on any emulator integrated with RA. See also : Memory Digging Tips . Memory Inspector Dialog link 1. New Search link This is the first thing you must do when you're looking for something in memory. The first drop down allows you to quick select All memory, System RAM, or Cartridge RAM. The field below the first drop down lets you type in a custom range (i.e. 0x10000-0x100FF). The second drop down specifies the size of the data you're interested in finding. The Reset button clears out any previously captured results (part 3 of the dialog) and captures the current memory state. 2. Filter link Filters the memory state in an attempt to locate a specific memory address. The first drop down allows you to specify the comparison to use. The second drop down is what you're comparing against. Most of the time you're going to be filtering on != Last Value , which eliminates any results where the memory has changed. The available comparisons are: * Constant - comparison is made against the value entered in the field below the drop down. * Last Value - comparison is made against the value captured by the last applied filter, or the initial value if no filter has been applied * Last Value Plus - comparison is made against the Last Value plus the value entered in the field below the drop down. If the value were 3, the comparison would me made against a number which is three higher than the Last Value for each value captured by the last applied filter. * Last Value Minus - the same as Last Value Plus, except the value entered in the field below the drop down is subtracted from each value captured by the last applied filter. * Initial Value - comparison is made against the value captured when the New Search was begun. The Filter Once button immediately applies the selected filter and updates the Results. The Continuous Filter button applies the selected filter repeatedly until stopped. The fewer the results, the more frequently the filter is applied. The filter is only applied once every N ms, where N is the number of results / 1000. If there are less than 1000 results, it's applied every frame. If there are 50000 results, it's applied every 500ms (twice a second). If there are 1000000 results, it's only applied every 10 seconds. 3. Results link As filtering is applied, the list of potential matches will appear here. On the left side is information about the results, including the number of matches, the filter applied, and how many filters have been applied. If you believe you have applied a filter incorrectly, or the filter results in no matches, you can use the << button to return to the previous set of results. You can do this all the way back to the initial results. Similarly, you can use the >> button to return to results you have backed out of. Once you apply a new filter, the forward filters are discarded and the >> button is disabled. Below the result information are two buttons. The first allows you to manually remove the selected items from the result set. You can use Ctrl and Shift to select multiple items. The second lets you create a bookmark for an item in the result set. It will appear in the Bookmarks dialog. The items in the result set show the address of the match, the current value, and a brief description of the memory at the address. If a code note exists for the address, it will be shown. Otherwise, a general classification of the address will be shown. Additionally, items in the result set can be colored. * Red - the item does not currently match the filter * Grey - the item does currently match the filter, but at some point since the filter was applied it did not match. * Green - the item is bookmarked * Blue - the item has a code note Clicking on a row will set the selected address to the associated item. 4. Code Notes link Provides detailed information about the selected address, and allows the user to annotate addresses found by the search process. Try to keep your descriptions simple and clear, so they can be easily understood. Clear notes are important for debugging if a problem with an achievement occurs. The text field shows the currently selected address from the memory view (part 5 of the dialog). You can manually type in any address, or use the up and down arrows to jump to the next or previous address that have a code note. Just to the right of the text field is a button that opens the Code Notes dialog, which allows you to browse and search through the code notes. Below the text field is a button that will create a bookmark from the selected address. The large text area is where you can modify the code note for the selected address. NOTE: the changes are not saved unless you press the Save Note button. If you change the selected address without saving, the changes will be lost. Save Note and Delete immediately attempt to update the server - either with the modified note text, or by clearing out the note text. 5. Memory View link Allows direct browsing of the memory. The memory updates once per frame as the emulator runs. The currently selected address appears in red. Addresses with code notes show up blue, and addresses associated to bookmarks show up green. You can click on any piece of data in the memory viewer to jump to the associated address. You can also use the keyboard to navigation around in memory (up/down/left/right/pgup/pgdn/home/end). When the memory viewer is focused, a cursor will be visible. You can type any hexadecimal character to change the character at the cursor to another value. This immediately changes the value for the emulator, and may cause unexpected behavior, so use at your own risk. Additionally, modifying memory (through any of the tools) prevents achievements from being unlocked on the server as an anti-cheat mechanism. Memory Bookmarks link You can open the Memory Bookmarks dialog from the RetroAchievements menu. It will also automatically open when adding a bookmark from either of the buttons on the Memory Inspector dialog. With this, you can view multiple designated addresses at once instead of having to shuffle around in the Inspector. Bookmarked addresses will show in the Memory Inspector as green. If you double-click on an address, you can move straight to that address in the Memory Inspector. The bookmarks can be renamed by clicking their description. This does not update the code note for the associated address. You can change the size or format of a bookmark by clicking on the field and selecting a new value from the dropdown. Clicking on the value field will allow you to enter a new value for the bookmark. It will automatically be written to the memory. From here you can also Freeze any bookmarks. This is helpful for things like health or consumables. Keep in mind, freezing occurs 1 frame after gameplay. This means that even when frozen, the value will change for at least one frame before returning to the frozen value. Frozen bookmarks will be displayed as yellow. Reading data in the Memory Viewer link Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal notations link To work well with the Memory Viewer, it's important to understand at least the basics of binary and hexadecimal numeral notations. Here are good sources of information about this matter without going into extreme details: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_numeral_system The digits used in binary system are 0 and 1 . A binary digit is also known as bit . Eight bits is also known as one byte . The digits used in hexadecimal system are 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , A , B , C , D , E and F . The hexadecimal notation is also known as hex . The main reasons for the existence of these 2 notations, besides the traditional decimal notation, are: Decimal notation is what humans understand. Binary notation is what computers \"understand\". Hexadecimal notation can be seen as a middle ground between binary and decimal. Because a single hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits, then a shorter and more understandable notation for humans to work in a way that the computer \"understands\". The table below shows the different notations for equivalent values. Decimal Hexadecimal Binary 0 0x0 0000 1 0x1 0001 2 0x2 0010 3 0x3 0011 4 0x4 0100 5 0x5 0101 6 0x6 0110 7 0x7 0111 8 0x8 1000 9 0x9 1001 10 0xA 1010 11 0xB 1011 12 0xC 1100 13 0xD 1101 14 0xE 1110 15 0xF 1111 More facts about the different number notations: To indicate a value is written in hexadecimal, the prefix 0x is used: 0x10 = 16 , 10 = 10 . Two hex digits represent 8 bits and can range from 0 to 255 . Four hex digits represent 16 bits and can range 0 to 65535 . Eight hex digits represent 32 bits and can range from 0 to 4294967295 . Memory Viewer modes link The bottom part of the Memory Inspector is what we call the Memory Viewer: You can see data in Memory Viewer using 8, 16 or 32-bit modes. 8-bit mode link By default, the Memory Viewer shows data in 8-bit mode. This displays each byte of memory as a separate two-character hexadecimal value. And each byte has its own address. Sixteen bytes are shown per line. The address of a byte can be determined by adding the row index (displayed to the left of the viewer) to the column index (displayed above the viewer). Using the image above as an example, the cursor is at 0x002a7 ( 0x002a0 + 7 ). 16/32-bit mode link Before we talk about 16-bit mode and 32-bit mode, it's important to know about endianness: Endianness link Endianness describes the order in which a sequence of bytes are stored in computer systems memory. The two most common types are: Big-Endian (also known as BE) and Little-Endian (also known as LE). In the Big-Endian order the \"big end\" of the number (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first (placed at the lowest address). In the image below you see the number 0x12345678 stored at the address 0x100 in the big-endian order. Notice that the most significant byte 0x12 is at the address 0x100 : In the Little-Endian order the \"little end\" of the number (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first. In the image below you see the number 0x12345678 stored at the address 0x100 in the little-endian order. Notice that the least significant byte 0x78 is at the address 0x100 : Values that need more then 8-bits (in other words: larger than 255) have to be stored in multiple bytes. However, the emulated systems we use store multi-byte values in little-endian order. In the image of the Memory Viewer above you can see that at address 0x0002c0 we have the hex value ce and in 0x0002c1 the value is 39 . When you switch the viewer to 16-bit mode, the ce and 39 values are grouped at 0x0002c0 and get displayed as 39ce . This happens because it automatically groups every two bytes and displays them as 16-bit hex values. NOTE : While 16-bit values are usually aligned to even addresses, that's not always the case. There's actually a non-displayed 16-bit value at 0x0002c1 . Since the value at 0x0002c1 is 39 and the value at 0x0002c2 is 29 , the 16-bit value at 0x0002c1 address is 0x2939 . Similarly, in 32-bit mode, the four bytes from 0x0002c0 to 0x0002c3 are displayed as a single 32-bit value 0x252939ce at address 0x0002c0 , but there are also 32-bit values at 0x0002c1 , 0x0002c2 , and 0x0002c3 . Working with sizes smaller than 8-bit link In addition to the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit sizes described above, there are additional sizes that can be used when writing achievements (in the Achievement Editor). Single bits link In the memory viewer when an 8-bit address is selected you will see something like the image below (in the image: a byte with the value 6f is selected; the bits are highlighted with an orange circle): It is very common in games to store important information as a single bit. As a bit can only have two possible values ( 1 or 0 ), sometimes it's used to mean \"yes\" or \"no\", \"on\" or \"off\", \"have item\" or \"no item\", etc. Some games, specially those with limited memory space, use bit switches a lot. Important: You can refer to each one of those bits individually in the Achievement Editor. Common meaning of bit switches in a game memory: have an item button pressed (very common) area explored in game trigger activated cheat activated in demo mode In the memory viewer you can only input hex values, then it's important to know equivalence of values between hex and binary notations. You can see the table in the \" Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal notations \" section, but the usual is to use a calculator (the default calculator on MS Windows on the programmer view can do the job). Upper4 and Lower4 link Upper4 is the upper four bits of a byte (bit: 7, 6, 5, 4), displayed as a single hexadecimal character. Lower4 is the lower four bits of a byte (bit: 3, 2, 1, 0), displayed as a single hexadecimal character. Looking at the memory size diagram below, a byte at address 0x00a274 is selected (value 0x23 ). The first character, 2 is the Upper4 value. The second character 3 is the Lower4 value. Occasionally you will only be interested working with a single hexadecimal digit. Using the memory size diagram as an example, an achievement condition where Upper4 0x00a274 = 0x2 would be true. A condition where Lower4 0x00a274 = 0x3 would be true.

Here are good sources of information about this matter without going into extreme details: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_numeral_system The digits used in binary system are 0 and 1 . A binary digit is also known as bit . Eight bits is also known as one byte . The digits used in hexadecimal system are 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , A , B , C , D , E and F . The hexadecimal notation is also known as hex . The main reasons for the existence of these 2 notations, besides the traditional decimal notation, are: Decimal notation is what humans understand. Binary notation is what computers \"understand\". Hexadecimal notation can be seen as a middle ground between binary and decimal. Because a single hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits, then a shorter and more understandable notation for humans to work in a way that the computer \"understands\". The table below shows the different notations for equivalent values. Decimal Hexadecimal Binary 0 0x0 0000 1 0x1 0001 2 0x2 0010 3 0x3 0011 4 0x4 0100 5 0x5 0101 6 0x6 0110 7 0x7 0111 8 0x8 1000 9 0x9 1001 10 0xA 1010 11 0xB 1011 12 0xC 1100 13 0xD 1101 14 0xE 1110 15 0xF 1111 More facts about the different number notations: To indicate a value is written in hexadecimal, the prefix 0x is used: 0x10 = 16 , 10 = 10 . Two hex digits represent 8 bits and can range from 0 to 255 . Four hex digits represent 16 bits and can range 0 to 65535 . Eight hex digits represent 32 bits and can range from 0 to 4294967295 .","title":"Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal notations"},{"location":"Memory-Inspector-Overview/#memory-viewer-modes","text":"The bottom part of the Memory Inspector is what we call the Memory Viewer: You can see data in Memory Viewer using 8, 16 or 32-bit modes.","title":"Memory Viewer modes"},{"location":"Memory-Inspector-Overview/#8-bit-mode","text":"By default, the Memory Viewer shows data in 8-bit mode. This displays each byte of memory as a separate two-character hexadecimal value. And each byte has its own address. Sixteen bytes are shown per line. The address of a byte can be determined by adding the row index (displayed to the left of the viewer) to the column index (displayed above the viewer). Using the image above as an example, the cursor is at 0x002a7 ( 0x002a0 + 7 ).","title":"8-bit mode"},{"location":"Memory-Inspector-Overview/#1632-bit-mode","text":"Before we talk about 16-bit mode and 32-bit mode, it's important to know about endianness:","title":"16/32-bit mode"},{"location":"Memory-Inspector-Overview/#endianness","text":"Endianness describes the order in which a sequence of bytes are stored in computer systems memory. The two most common types are: Big-Endian (also known as BE) and Little-Endian (also known as LE). In the Big-Endian order the \"big end\" of the number (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first (placed at the lowest address). In the image below you see the number 0x12345678 stored at the address 0x100 in the big-endian order. Notice that the most significant byte 0x12 is at the address 0x100 : In the Little-Endian order the \"little end\" of the number (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first. In the image below you see the number 0x12345678 stored at the address 0x100 in the little-endian order. Notice that the least significant byte 0x78 is at the address 0x100 : Values that need more then 8-bits (in other words: larger than 255) have to be stored in multiple bytes. However, the emulated systems we use store multi-byte values in little-endian order. In the image of the Memory Viewer above you can see that at address 0x0002c0 we have the hex value ce and in 0x0002c1 the value is 39 . When you switch the viewer to 16-bit mode, the ce and 39 values are grouped at 0x0002c0 and get displayed as 39ce . This happens because it automatically groups every two bytes and displays them as 16-bit hex values. NOTE : While 16-bit values are usually aligned to even addresses, that's not always the case. There's actually a non-displayed 16-bit value at 0x0002c1 . Since the value at 0x0002c1 is 39 and the value at 0x0002c2 is 29 , the 16-bit value at 0x0002c1 address is 0x2939 . Similarly, in 32-bit mode, the four bytes from 0x0002c0 to 0x0002c3 are displayed as a single 32-bit value 0x252939ce at address 0x0002c0 , but there are also 32-bit values at 0x0002c1 , 0x0002c2 , and 0x0002c3 .","title":"Endianness"},{"location":"Memory-Inspector-Overview/#working-with-sizes-smaller-than-8-bit","text":"In addition to the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit sizes described above, there are additional sizes that can be used when writing achievements (in the Achievement Editor).","title":"Working with sizes smaller than 8-bit"},{"location":"Memory-Inspector-Overview/#single-bits","text":"In the memory viewer when an 8-bit address is selected you will see something like the image below (in the image: a byte with the value 6f is selected; the bits are highlighted with an orange circle): It is very common in games to store important information as a single bit. As a bit can only have two possible values ( 1 or 0 ), sometimes it's used to mean \"yes\" or \"no\", \"on\" or \"off\", \"have item\" or \"no item\", etc. Some games, specially those with limited memory space, use bit switches a lot. Important: You can refer to each one of those bits individually in the Achievement Editor. Common meaning of bit switches in a game memory: have an item button pressed (very common) area explored in game trigger activated cheat activated in demo mode In the memory viewer you can only input hex values, then it's important to know equivalence of values between hex and binary notations.

The first character, 2 is the Upper4 value. The second character 3 is the Lower4 value. Occasionally you will only be interested working with a single hexadecimal digit.

RetroAchievements.org \u00e9 uma comunidade sem fins lucrativos que colabora e compete para ganhar conquistas personalizadas em jogos cl\u00e1ssicos atrav\u00e9s de emula\u00e7\u00e3o. As conquistas s\u00e3o criadas pela e para a comunidade. (...) Neste manifesto n\u00f3s vamos nos aprofundar nessa resposta. RetroAchievements.org \u00e9 uma comunidade sem fins lucrativos link N\u00f3s temos um link de doa\u00e7\u00f5es na nossa p\u00e1gina principal, mas ainda assim n\u00f3s somos uma comunidade sem fins lucrativos. Os patronos contribuem com, literalmente, um d\u00f3lar (1 USD) por m\u00eas e, felizmente, n\u00f3s temos patronos suficiente para pagar o servidor sem que precisemos recorrer aos an\u00fancios irritantes. No entanto, queremos deixar bem claro que obter doa\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o \u00e9 o nosso modelo de neg\u00f3cio pelo exato motivo de que RetroAchievements n\u00e3o \u00e9 um neg\u00f3cio! Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es de neg\u00f3cios est\u00e3o sempre ansiosas para obter mais e mais clientes. Elas fazem o que elas podem para agradar os clientes e continuar obtendo cada vez mais. Mas aqui, no RetroAchievements, n\u00f3s n\u00e3o somos um neg\u00f3cio, n\u00f3s somos uma comunidade . N\u00e3o temos clientes, n\u00f3s temos membros da comunidade. N\u00f3s somos um grupo de pessoas apaixonadas por retrogames. E se voc\u00ea compartilhar da mesma paix\u00e3o, voc\u00ea \u00e9 muito bem vindo a se juntar a n\u00f3s! Embora estejamos de portas abertas para receber bem qualquer um, n\u00f3s n\u00e3o estamos desesperadamente implorando por mais usu\u00e1rios. Cabe a voc\u00ea decidir: se voc\u00ea gosta do que n\u00f3s temos a oferecer, pegue o seu joystick e vamos jogar alguns cl\u00e1ssicos! Conquistas s\u00e3o feitas pela e para a comunidade link Isto est\u00e1 relacionada com o que foi dito acima. N\u00f3s n\u00e3o estamos oferecendo um servi\u00e7o para pessoas de fora. As coisas que criamos nesta comunidade s\u00e3o para esta mesma comunidade. Voc\u00ea \u00e9 bem-vindo a ficar com a gente, mas cabe a voc\u00ea decidir se quer ser parte disso. E enquanto fizer parte desta comunidade, tenha sempre em mente as seguintes afirma\u00e7\u00f5es: 1. A coisa mais importante que n\u00f3s temos aqui s\u00e3o as conquistas. 2. As pessoas mais importantes que n\u00f3s temos aqui s\u00e3o os criadores de conquistas. E o que isso significa? Abaixo, abordaremos de forma mais detalhada cada conceito e os motivos de serem t\u00e3o fundamentais: A coisa mais importante que n\u00f3s temos aqui s\u00e3o as conquistas link N\u00f3s todos amamos aquelas ins\u00edgnias na nossa p\u00e1gina do perfil, certo? Tal apego aquela ins\u00edgnia, \u00e0s vezes, causa frustra\u00e7\u00e3o quando a respectiva cole\u00e7\u00e3o de conquistas recebe uma revis\u00e3o, mas \u00e9 importante ter em mente que este projeto est\u00e1 constantemente evoluindo. N\u00f3s fazemos revis\u00f5es nas conquistas tendo em mente a qualidade e para mostrar verdadeiro respeito pelo jogo. Tamb\u00e9m respeitamos os trof\u00e9us que voc\u00ea obteve, mas melhorar a qualidade geral do projeto tem preced\u00eancia sobre nossas p\u00e1ginas de perfil e/ou quantidade de pontos. Al\u00e9m disso, se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o for capaz de obter todas as conquistas de um jogo, isso n\u00e3o significa automaticamente que elas precis\u00e3o ser suavizadas/removidas/se tornarem conquistas b\u00f4nus. Se outros jogadores obtiveram aquelas conquistas, \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m consiga. Contudo, se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o consegue, est\u00e1 tudo bem tamb\u00e9m. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa desbloquear todas as conquistas para continuar se divertindo com jogos antigos. Se ainda assim voc\u00ea acha que a cole\u00e7\u00e3o de conquistas possui conceitos indesej\u00e1veis , voc\u00ea pode postar seus argumentos no f\u00f3rum no t\u00f3pico do jogo. Apenas certifique-se de ser respeitoso em suas palavras. O que nos leva ao pr\u00f3ximo ponto... As pessoas mais importantes que n\u00f3s temos aqui s\u00e3o os criadores de conquistas link N\u00e3o nos entenda mal! O ecossistema do RetroAchievements tem muitas pessoas executando muitos papeis diferentes de criar conquistas \u2014 e elas s\u00e3o todas importantes. Os criadores de conquistas s\u00e3o a espinha dorsal desse projeto. Sem eles, isso aqui \u00e9 apenas um site bugado e antiquado. Cria\u00e7\u00e3o de conquistas \u00e9 uma atividade que consome muito tempo. As pessoas que fazem isso dedicam uma grande parte do seu tempo livre produzindo conte\u00fado em prol de toda a comunidade. De qualquer forma, mesmo que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o consiga ou n\u00e3o esteja interessado em criar conquistas e queira apenas jogar, voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 importante para n\u00f3s! Na verdade n\u00f3s temos in\u00fameros jogadores que s\u00e3o membros muito valiosos . O ponto-chave aqui \u00e9: envolva-se e seja legal. Quanto mais voc\u00ea se envolve, mais valioso voc\u00ea \u00e9 para a comunidade. Por \u00faltimo, mas n\u00e3o menos importante, se voc\u00ea tiver cr\u00edticas sobre o trabalho dos criadores de conquistas, seja respeitoso. Demonstrar hostilidade em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a eles \u00e9 fortemente desaprovado. Seja desrespeitoso com eles e voc\u00ea definitivamente n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 bem-vindo aqui.

Since the early days of RetroAchievements, this is what we have in our FAQ as the answer for What is RetroAchievements.org? RetroAchievements.org is a zero profit community who collaborate and compete to earn custom-made achievements in classic games through emulation. Achievements are made by and for the community. (...) In this manifesto we're going to go deeper into that answer. RetroAchievements.org is a zero profit community link We do have a donation link on our frontpage, but we're still a zero profit community. The patrons contribute with literally one dollar per month, and fortunately we have enough patrons to pay the server without needing to rely on annoying adverts. However, we want to make very clear that getting donations is not our business model, exactly because RetroAchievements is not a business! Business organizations are always eager to get more customers. They do what they can to please the customers and keep getting more and more of them. But here, at RetroAchievements, we are not a business, we are a community . We don't have customers, we have community members. We are a bunch of people passionate about retrogames. And if you share the same passion, you're very welcome to join us. Although we're welcoming anyone, we're not desperately begging for more and more users. It's your call: if you like what we have to offer, pick your gamepad and let's play some classics! Achievements are made by and for the community. link It's related to what was said above. We are not offering a service for outsiders. The things we create in this community are for this very same community. You're welcome to stay with us, but it's up to you to decide if you want to be part of it. And while being part of this community, always keep in mind the following statements: 1. The most important thing we have here are the achievements. 2. The most important people we have here are the achievement creators. What does that mean? The most important thing we have here are the achievements. link We all love those badges on our profile page, right? Such attachment to that badge sometimes causes frustration when the respective achievement set get a revision. But it's important to keep in mind that this project is constantly evolving. We make achievement set revisions with quality in mind, and to show actual respect for the game. We also have respect for the awards you got, but improving the overall quality of the project has precedence over our individual profile pages and/or our amount of points. Also, if you're not able to master an achievement set it doesn't automatically mean that it needs to be nerfed/demoted/turned into a bonus set. If other players got that, it's probable you can get that too. But if you can't, it's OK too. You don't need to unlock every achievement to keep having fun with old games. If you still think the achievement set has unwelcome concepts , you can post your arguments in the game's forum topic. Just be sure to be respectful in your words. Which brings us to the next point... The most important people we have here are the achievement creators. link Don't get it wrong! The RetroAchievements ecosystem has a lot of people, playing many different roles than creating achievements, and they are all important. But the achievement creators are the backbone of this project. Without them, this is just a buggy and old fashioned website. Achievement creation is a very time consuming activity. The people doing it dedicate a big portion of their free time producing content for the benefit of the whole community. Anyways, even if you're not able to/interested in creating achievements and just want to play, you're also important to us. In fact we have countless players that are very valuable members . The key point here is: get involved and be nice. The more you get involved, the more valuable you are to the community. Last but not least, if you have criticism about achievement creators' work, be respectful. Showing bitterness towards them is strongly frowned upon.

Para tener RP en un juego necesitas un Script de Rich Presence (RPS) que este es creador por desarrolladores. El Script checa la memoria del juego y ya sea como esta fue programada reporta los valores de ciertas direcciones con definiciones asignadas por el desarrollador as\u00ed como en que stage se encuentra el jugador, cuantas vidas tienes, si el juego esta en pausa, que modo de juego se encuentra jugando, lo que a logrado el jugador, etc. Esta informacion es reportada de vuelta al sitio. Cada juego publicado deber\u00eda de tener m\u00ednimo un RPS b\u00e1sico. Ejemplo de RP en acci\u00f3n: Para ver la RP en tiempo real haz clic en el menu de RetroAchievements en tu emulador y despu\u00e9s en Rich Presence Monitor. Una peque\u00f1a ventana deber\u00eda de mostrar tu RP actual. (Bueno para realizar pruebas) La mejor manera de entender Rich Presence es observar varios ejemplos de juegos, mira las direcciones que fueron utilizadas a mira como el texto es mostrado en el monitor y en el sitio. Como funciona? link Cada vez que un juego es lanzado, guarda los logros del juego en un archivo de 'ruta' donde el ROM detalla todos los logros y valores en memoria (y tablas clasificatorias) que puede llegar a rastrear. Tambi\u00e9n va a solicitar un Script de Rich Presence para el ROM que se encuentre actualmente cargado. El emulador va a reportar al sitio web cada 120 segundos. Similarmente, cada 120 segundos o parecido, la caja de 'active players' en la pagina de inicio se va a refrescar, detallando la ultima actividad conocida por todos los jugadores activos. Si no hay un Script de rich presence entregado, el texto sera 'earning achievements' Si se esta jugando un juego con logros, 'playing [game]' si se juega un juego sin logros, o 'developing achievements' si la ventaba de memoria esta abierta y es visible. El RPS de cada juego puede ser encontrado en la secci\u00f3n de desarrollo en cada pagina de juego: Ejemplo (Super Mario Bros.) link Format:Digit FormatType=VALUE Lookup:Mode 0=[Demo] 2=[World Complete] Lookup:Paused 0x81=\u258c\u258c 0x80=\u258c\u258c 1=\u258c\u258c Lookup:Star 5=\ud83c\udf1f 4=\ud83c\udf1f 3=\ud83c\udf1f 2=\ud83c\udf1f 1=\ud83c\udf1f Lookup:Powerup 0=Small 1=Super 2=Fire Lookup:Swimming 1= swimming Lookup:Status 0= [Loading] 1= taking a vine warp 2= entering a warp pipe 3= entering a warp pipe 4= \ud83d\udea9 5= [Stage Complete] 6= [Game Over] 7= [Entering Area] 9= growing 0xA= shrinking 0xB= \ud83d\udc80 0xC= powering up Lookup:Quest 0x0=1st 0x1=2nd Display: @Mode(0xh770)@Paused(0xh776)@Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f)@Powerup(0xh0756) Mario in @Digit(0xh75f_v1)-@Digit(0xh75c_v1)@Swimming(0xh704)@Status(0xhe), \ud83d\udeb6:@Digit(0xh75a_v1), @Quest(0xh7fc) Quest El RSP se compone de objetos de Lookup, objectos de Formato y un objeto de Display. Lookups link Los Lookups se definen de la siguiente manera: Lookup:NombreDelLockup Valor1=Texto cuando este valor este activo Valor2=Texto cuando este otro valor ... Le damos un valor al Lookup, consistiendo de una serie de direcciones de memoria y modificador. Encontraras mas sobre esto mas adelante. Formato link Las Tablas de Formato se definen de la siguiente manera: Format:Score FormatType=VALOR Empezamos con Formato: , y despu\u00e9s con el nombre del tipo de formato. En la siguiente linea, escribe FormatType= , y entonces uno de los siguientes valores: VALUE , SCORE (o POINTS ), TIME (o FRAMES ), SECS , MILLISECS , o OTHER . VALUE : valor gen\u00e9rico, no se agregan ceros. SCORE / POINTS : \"000130 puntos\" TIME / FRAMES : este valor describe el numero de frames consecuentes, y se va a mostrar como 00:00.00 SECS : este valor describe el numero de segundos que han pasado, y se va a mostrar como 00:00 MILLISECS : este valor describe el numero de centenas de segundo que han pasado, y se va a mostrar como 00:00.00 Display link Display es la string que se muestra en la caja de 'Active Players' en la pagina de inicio del sitio web. Para referirte a un Lookup o aun Format previamente definidos se utiliza simplemente un '@'. Y entonces se agrega el nombre que le diste al lookup o al format (distingue may\u00fasculas y min\u00fasculas!), e inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de eso, en brackets, sigue la serie de valores en memoria que especifican que sera enviado a ese lookup y format. @Powerup(0xh756) Eso significa que vas a utilizar el Lookup o Format que se llama Powerup , y entrega cualquier valor que se encuentre actualmente en 0xh756. Analizando el Lookup de Ejemplo link @Mode(0xh770) - Un Lookup para la direcci\u00f3n que muestra si el juego se encuentra en modo demo o si un mundo a sido completado. @Paused(0xh776) - Un Lookup para la direcci\u00f3n que muestra si el juego se encuentra en pausa (Se utilizan 3 valores, dos de ellos son para pausar y despausar). @Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f) - Un Lookup para la direcci\u00f3n que muestra si Mario tiene la Estrella. Mas sobre esto mas adelante. @Powerup(0xh756) - Un Lookup para la direcci\u00f3n que muestra si Mario es Peque\u00f1o, grande o cuenta con la habilidad de fuego. Mario in - Texto est\u00e1tico para unir los objetos format y lookup. @Digit(0xh75f_v1) - Digit es un objeto format definido como un valor. La direcci\u00f3n 0xh75f es Mundo menos 1 (porque cuenta con base 0, y este empieza a contar desde cero). _v1 Significa + valor 1. _v+1 tambi\u00e9n es correcto. - - Mas texto est\u00e1tico para separar el mundo y el nivel. como en el juego Mundo 1-1. @Digit(0xh75c_v1) - Otro uso del objeto Digit format . Esta vez se encuentra rastreando el Stage. Mundo 1-X. @Swimming(0xh704) - Un Lookup para la direcci\u00f3n que muestra si el jugador se encuentra nadando. @Status(0xhe) - Un Lookup para la direcci\u00f3n que muestra el estatus de Mario, como por ejemplo descendiendo de un tubo. , \ud83d\udeb6: - Mas texto est\u00e1tico. \ud83d\udeb6 es el s\u00edmbolo para vidas. @Digit(0xh75a_v1) - Tercer uso del objeto Digit format. Esta vez checa la direcci\u00f3n de vidas del jugador. , - Texto est\u00e1tico. @Quest(0xh7fc) Un lookup para ver si el jugador se encuentra en modo normal o en la 2da vuelta (modo dificil). Quest - Texto est\u00e1tico. Tama\u00f1o de Direcciones link Para especificar el tama\u00f1o de la direcci\u00f3n que te encuentras utilizando, hay varios caracteres que se utilizan para esto. (se ignora si es may\u00fascula o min\u00fascula) Una direcci\u00f3n de 16bit es el default y esta no cuenta con un car\u00e1cter designado. En 0x10 la direcci\u00f3n es de dos bytes - 16 bits. El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n de 8bit es h (o H ). En 0xh10 la direcci\u00f3n es un byte - 8 bits. xxxx xxxx El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n upper4 es u (o U ). En 0xu10 la direcci\u00f3n es un nibble - 4 bits. xxxx 0000 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n lower4 es l (o L ). En 0xl10 la direcci\u00f3n es un nibble - 4 bits. 0000 xxxx El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit0 es m (o M ). En 0xm10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el bit mas bajo: 0000 000x El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit1 es n (o N ). En 0xn10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el segundo bit: 0000 00x0 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit2 es o (o O ). En 0xo10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el tercer bit: 0000 0x00 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit3 es p (o P ). En 0xp10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el cuarto bit: 0000 x000 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit4 es q (o Q ). En 0xq10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el quinto bit: 000x 0000 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit5 es r (o R ). En 0xr10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el sexto bit: 00x0 0000 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit6 es s (o S ). En 0xs10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el s\u00e9ptimo bit: 0x00 0000 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n bit7 es t (o T ). En 0xt10 la direcci\u00f3n es un bit, el bit mas alto: x000 0000 El car\u00e1cter para una direcci\u00f3n de 32bit es x (o X ). En 0xx10 la direcci\u00f3n es de cuatro bytes y 32 bits.

Si la siguiente linea empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, se considera como un display con una string condicional. La parte de la linea que se encuentra entre los dos signos de interrogaci\u00f3n es la clausula de la condici\u00f3n. Si la clausula de la condici\u00f3n se eval\u00faa y esta es verdadera, entonces la siguiente parte de la linea se utiliza como el string del display. Si esta no se eval\u00faa como verdadera, entonces se procede a la siguiente linea. Si esta empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, entonces el mismo proceso se repite. Si este no empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, la linea entera se utiliza como el string default para el display. NOTA : Se requiere una string default en caso de que ninguna de tus strings condicionales sean verdaderas. Si solamente cuentas con strings condicionales, el script no va a hacer nada. Observando este ejemplo, si el valor de 16-bit en $0085 es igual a 0, el string del display sera Title Screen . Si no, la siguiente linea es examinada. Si el 7mo bit de $007C es igual a 1, el string del display sera Mapa Personalizado en @Zona(0xH00016c) . Si no entonces, como linea final no cuenta con una clausula condicional esta es utilizada. Strings de Display asociados con una clausula condicional soportan todo la misma sintaxis que el string de display predeterminado. En este ejemplo, puedes ver que el lookup @Zona se utiliza en los dos strings condicionales y en el string predeterminado. La frase condicional soporta todos los asesores de direcciones previamente mencionados as\u00ed como la l\u00f3gica de los AND (_) y OR (S). Nota: las clausulas OR aun requieren un grupo 'core', as\u00ed como en los logros . ?0xH1234=32_0xH2345=0?ejemplo y si el valor de 8-bit en $1234 es 32 y el valor de 8-bit en $2345 is 0, muestra ejemplo y ?0xH1234=32S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?ejemplo o si el valor de 8-bit en $1234 es 32 y el valor de 8-bit en $2345 es 1 o 2, muestra ejemplo o ?0xH1234=32_0xH5678=33S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?ejemplo y/o si el valor de 8-bit en $1234 es 32 y el valor de 8-bit en $5678 es 33 y el valor de 8-bit en $2345 es 1 o 2, muestra ejemplo y/o C\u00f3digo Binario programado en Decimal (BCD) link BCD es cuando cuando los valores son almacenados en una direcci\u00f3n del 0-9 (un d\u00edgito) o 0-99 (dos d\u00edgitos). ten en mente que la mayor\u00eda de las veces los valores son almacenados en hexadecimal, pero algunas veces los juegos los almacenan de esta manera y aqu\u00ed esta el mejor m\u00e9todo para trabajar con este tipo de valores en tu display. BCD decodifica cada car\u00e1cter hexadecimal como un d\u00edgito decimal. Si el inspector de memoria muestra un 86 (en hex), el resulta de BCD decodificando el valor seria un 86 (en decimal). Para objectos con estos valores puedes utilizar le prefijo BCD, como aqu\u00ed b0xh1234 . Esto tambi\u00e9n funciona con valores en tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n . Ten en cuenta que tambi\u00e9n vas a necesitar especificar el tama\u00f1o de la direcci\u00f3n BCD en memoria. b0x1234 lee un valor de 16-bit. b0xh1234 lee un valor de 8-bit y b0xX1234 lee un valor de 32-bit. NOTA : Soporte para decodificacion BCD de 16-bit y 32-bit es una funci\u00f3n para el kit de desarrollo 0.075. Esto es usualmente usado para puntuaciones y tiempo, pero algunas veces tambi\u00e9n para otros tipos de valores. Limites link Limite de 16,000 caracteres por script Limite de 100 caracteres para lo que se esta mostrando Caracteres Unicode son permitidos Detalles de la Sintaxis link Las llaves para Lookups son en decimal por default y hex si agregas el prefijo 0x . Esto significa 1 == 0x1 , 2 == 0x2 , 9 == 0x9 , 10 == 0xa , 100 == 0x64 , etc. Los nombres para Lookup/Format son sensibles entre may\u00fasculas y min\u00fasculas por lo que necesitas escribir exactamente igual el nombre para que se muestre correctamente en el string del display: @test(0x1234) el cual no va a encontrar \"Format:Test\" Un Lookup/Format no pueden contener espacios antes o despu\u00e9s del nombre. @test(0x1234) no va a encontrar \"Format:test \" o \"Format: test\" Si tu Lookup/Format no puede ser encontrado, no se va a mostrar nada. Esta es una prueba @test(0x1234). va a salir como Esto es una . si test no puede ser encontrado. Se pueden agregar comentarios en cualquier parte del script. Una doble diagonal ( // ) indica que la parte restante de la linea va a ser ignorada cuando se procese el script. Nota: los comentarios tambi\u00e9n aplican para el tama\u00f1o m\u00e1ximo de caracteres del script. Tips y Trucos link Los nombres de los Lookup pueden ser tan cortos como un solo car\u00e1cter si necesitas ahorrarte algunos caracteres extras. Zeros subsecuentes pueden ser eliminados de las direcciones ( 0xh0001 puede ser acortado a 0xh1 ). Convertir todos tus valores de hex a decimal va tomar muchos menos caracteres. Caracteres Unicode no siempre \"toman menos espacio\" ellos usualmente toman hasta cuatro caracteres del sistema. Si un lookup no contiene ning\u00fan valor mapeados, va a resultar en un valor (sin espacio) en blanco. Puedes cambiar este comportamiento agregando una sola linea a los valores del lookup, '*' a el valor que deseas. Cada Lookup o Format puede ser cargado m\u00faltiples veces con las mismas o diferentes direcciones. Puedes definir un solo Format:Number FormatType=VALUE en vez de definir valores individuales para las vidas, Puntuaci\u00f3n, Nivel, etc. Poner espacios a tus lookups algunas veces antes o despues puede ayudarte a esconder ciertos lookups cuando estos no son requeridos, como lo hacen @Pause , @Star , @Swimming , y @Mode . Propiedades de los Valores link Cuando utilizamos objetos lookup y format @object() es posible combinar y hacer c\u00e1lculos. Esto puede ser utilizado para mostrar una puntuaci\u00f3n correctamente, tiempo del juego, etc. o hacen lookups avanzados. Ejemplo @Puntuaci\u00f3n(0x28*10_0x29*1000_0x26*100000) puntos Esto significa utiliza el lookup o Format Puntuaci\u00f3n , y entrega la suma de: - 0x28 10 veces, AGREGA - 0x29 1000 veces, AGREGA - 0x26 100000 veces _ agregas las direcciones mutuamente. O tambi\u00e9n puedes agregar un valor est\u00e1tico 0x28_v10 . Esto agrega un 10 a tu total, as\u00ed como el valor de 0x28 + 10 puede ser mostrado. Tambi\u00e9n se puede hacer lo mismo pero restando 0x28_v-10. Si lo que quieres es restar una direcci\u00f3n necesitas multiplicar el valor por -1. 0x29*-1 . 0x29 es ahora negativo. Si lo que quieres es hacer una divisi\u00f3n lo que necesitas es multiplicar por un numero quebrado. 0x26*.5 . 0x26 va a mostrar el valor 1/2 de 0x26 . Y as\u00ed puedes crear un string con todo junto: 0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10 . Tambi\u00e9n puedes agregar direcciones entre si para agregar a tus lookups de acuerdo a la suma de varias direcciones. Esto es utilizado en el ejemplo de @Star. Esta buscando la suma de los 6 bits mas bajos de la direcci\u00f3n 0xh79f. La manera en la que esta direcci\u00f3n trabaja es que mientras se encuentre un valor hay significa que Mario es invisible porque agarro una estrella y cuenta el valor hex en 0x23 (35 en decimal) a 0. 23 en binario es 0010 0011 significando que la suma m\u00e1xima de estos bits seria 5 durante 0001 1111 cuando el contador llega al valor hex de 0x1f (31 en decimal). S\u00edmbolos Est\u00e1ndar Unicode link Sin ninguna duda puedes utilizar estos s\u00edmbolos en rich presence. \u258c\u258c=Pausa \ud83d\udd01=Continues \u23f0=Tiempo de la Partida/Reloj del Juego \ud83d\udd11=Llaves \ud83d\udca3=Bombas \u2764\ufe0f o \u2764=En un juego con corazones (ej. Zelda) \ud83d\udcb0=Dinero \ud83d\udea9=Nivel/Stage Cuando te encuentres desarrollando Rich Presence tienes que hacegurarte que te estas comunicando de una manera completamente clara. Si no estas utilizando s\u00edmbolos estandarizados tal vez tengan sentido para ti pero tal vez sea completamente confusos para otros. Cuando utilices s\u00edmbolos no estandarizados, checalo con otro usuario o con alguna otra gente para ver si los s\u00edmbolos que estas utilizando tienen sentido. Si no lo tienen, utiliza mejores s\u00edmbolos, o utiliza texto o s\u00edmbolos junto con texto. Para unicode/emojis personalizados ShapeCatcher es un excelente recurso, puedes ponerte a dibujarlos y la AI va a buscar resultados similares. Simplemente ten cuidado de no utilizar unicode que sea demasiado oscuro , ya que no se va a mostrar correctamente en todos los sistemas. Toma nota en la preferencia de la comunidad en cuanto a displays: Desarrollando Rich Presence link La herramienta de desarrollo actualmente no cuenta con editor de Rich Presence integrado, pero puedes hacer pruebas locales antes de guardar algo en el servidor. Una vez que hubieras empezado un juego y el Rich Presence actual a sido descargado del servidor, puedes llegar a encontrar en RACache\\Data\\XXX-Rich.txt donde XXX es el ID del juego. El Monitor de Rich Presence (ejecutable desde el menu de RetroAchievments) lee este archivo y muestra el valor actual cada segundo mientras la ventana se encuentre abierta. Si haces cambios al archivo XXX-Rich.txt , y vuelves a reseleccionar la opci\u00f3n de monitor del menu, este va a leer los nuevos cambios para aqu\u00ed as\u00ed puedas hacer pruebas inmediatamente sin tener que aplicar cambios al servidor. Continua haciendo cambios y vuelve a seleccionar la opci\u00f3n en el menu asta que el script trabaje como esperas que lo haga, una vez que hubieras terminado copia el contenido del archivo a la pagina del servidor para que est\u00e9n los cambios disponibles para todos los dem\u00e1s jugadores. NOTA : El archivo XXX-Rich.txt es sobre-escrito con la informaci\u00f3n actual del servidor cada vez que el juego es abierto. Mientras aun tengas el archivo abierto en un editor, siempre vas a poder guardar tus cambios a pesar de re-abrir el juego.

Para ter RP em um jogo, voc\u00ea precisa de um Script do Estado de Presen\u00e7a (ou Rich Presence Script - RPS - pela sigla em ingl\u00eas). O Script verifica a mem\u00f3ria do jogo do jogador e como programado relata os valores de certos endere\u00e7os com defini\u00e7\u00f5es atribu\u00eddas pelo Desenvolvedor, como em qual est\u00e1gio o jogador est\u00e1, quantas vidas eles t\u00eam, se o jogo est\u00e1 em pausa, que modo de jogo eles est\u00e3o jogando, o que o jogador realizou, etc. Esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 reportada de volta ao site. Exemplo de RP em a\u00e7\u00e3o: Para ver o RP ao vivo em um jogo, clique no menu RetroAchievements no seu emulador e clique em Rich Presence Monitor. Uma pequena janela mostrar\u00e1 seu RP ativo. (Bom para depura\u00e7\u00e3o) A melhor maneira de entender o Estado de Presen\u00e7a \u00e9 olhar para v\u00e1rios exemplos no jogo, olhar para os endere\u00e7os usados e ver como o texto \u00e9 exibido no Rich Presence Monitor e no site.

Ele tamb\u00e9m solicitar\u00e1 um Rich Presence Script para a ROM atualmente carregada. O emulador informar\u00e1 o site a cada 120 segundos. Da mesma forma, a cada 120 segundos mais ou menos, a caixa de 'jogadores ativos' na frontpage ser\u00e1 atualizada, detalhando a \u00faltima atividade conhecida de todos os jogadores ativos.

A parte da linha entre os dois pontos de interroga\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a cl\u00e1usula condicional. Se a cl\u00e1usula condicional avaliar que \u00e9 verdadeiro (true), a parte restante da linha ser\u00e1 usada como a sequ\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o. Se n\u00e3o avaliar true, o processamento prosseguir\u00e1 para a pr\u00f3xima linha. Se come\u00e7ar com um ponto de interroga\u00e7\u00e3o, o mesmo processo ser\u00e1 repetido. Se n\u00e3o come\u00e7ar com um ponto de interroga\u00e7\u00e3o, a linha inteira ser\u00e1 usada como a sequ\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00e3o. Olhando para este exemplo, se o valor de 16 bits em $ 0085 for 0, a seq\u00fc\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 Title Screen . Se n\u00e3o, a pr\u00f3xima linha \u00e9 examinada.

Se n\u00e3o, a linha final n\u00e3o tem uma cl\u00e1usula condicional e \u00e9 usada. As cadeias de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o associadas a uma cl\u00e1usula condicional suportam a mesma sintaxe que a cadeia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00e3o. Neste exemplo, voc\u00ea pode ver que a pesquisa @Landscape \u00e9 usada na seq\u00fc\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o condicional e na sequ\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00e3o. A pesquisa em si s\u00f3 precisa ser definida uma vez. A frase condicional suporta todos os assessores de endere\u00e7o mencionados anteriormente, bem como a l\u00f3gica AND (_) e OR (S). Note que cl\u00e1usulas OR ainda requerem um grupo 'core', da mesma forma que as conquistas. ? 0xH1234 = 32_0xH2345 = 0? and example se o valor de 8 bits em $ 1234 for 32 e o valor de 8 bits em $ 2345 for 0, display and example ? 0xH1234 = 32_0xH2345 = 1S0xH2345 = 2? or example se o valor de 8 bits em $ 1234 for 32 e o valor de 8 bits em $ 2345 for 1 ou 2, exibir or example Decimal Bin\u00e1rio Codificado (DBC) link DBC \u00e9 quando os valores s\u00e3o armazenados em um endere\u00e7o de 0 a 9 (um d\u00edgito) ou 0 a 99 (dois d\u00edgitos). Na maioria das vezes os valores s\u00e3o armazenados em hexadecimal, mas em algum momento os jogos ir\u00e3o armazen\u00e1-los desta maneira e aqui est\u00e1 a melhor maneira de lidar com esses endere\u00e7os no seu monitor. Para objetos de valor, voc\u00ea pode usar o prefixo DBC, como em b0x1 . Um endere\u00e7o DBC \u00e9 considerado 8bit, h \u00e9 desnecess\u00e1rio, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o causar\u00e1 problemas. Outros prefixos de caracteres funcionam? (n\u00e3o testado). Quando voc\u00ea usa o prefixo b e o endere\u00e7o \u00e9 armazenado como um DBC, sua sa\u00edda para um endere\u00e7o de 10 ser\u00e1 10 em vez de 16 (que \u00e9 10 em hexadecimal). Isso \u00e9 mais comumente usado para pontua\u00e7\u00e3o e tempo, mas geralmente outros tipos de valores de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o. Limites link Limite de 2500 caracteres para script Limite de 100 caracteres para o que \u00e9 exibido Caracteres Unicode s\u00e3o permitidos Usar & no texto cortar\u00e1 o script ap\u00f3s o & Usando o personagem + n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 exibido Detalhes da Sintaxe link O RPS ignora 0s finais em pesquisas de endere\u00e7o hexadecimais e os valores 0x00001 == 0x1 , 0xh0000245 == 0xh245, 0x0a == 0xa . Os valores de pesquisa s\u00e3o Decimal por padr\u00e3o e hex se voc\u00ea colocar o prefixo de 0x . Isso significa 1 == 0x1 , 2 == 0x2 , 9 == 0x9 , 10 == 0xa , 100 == 0x64 , etc. Dicas e truques link As pesquisas devem ser espec\u00edficas de caso com seus @ correspondentes na exibi\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00e3o conter espa\u00e7os ap\u00f3s a pesquisa ser definida. Os nomes de pesquisa podem ser t\u00e3o curtos quanto um \u00fanico caractere se voc\u00ea precisar incluir alguns caracteres extras. Transformar todos os seus valores de hexadecimal em decimal ocupar\u00e1 menos caracteres. Caracteres Unicode nem sempre \"ocupam menos espa\u00e7o\", eles geralmente ocupam at\u00e9 quatro caracteres do sistema. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o definir suas pesquisas, elas ser\u00e3o deixadas em branco (sem espa\u00e7o). Apenas para NES, SNES, Gen, RAVBA. N64, Meka e Lynx deixar\u00e3o a palavra \"Desconhecido\" toda vez que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o definir uma pesquisa. Voc\u00ea s\u00f3 precisa de um objeto de formato de valor. Voc\u00ea pode referenci\u00e1-lo com v\u00e1rios endere\u00e7os. (isso \u00e9 sempre verdade?) Colocar espa\u00e7os em suas pesquisas algumas vezes antes ou depois pode permitir que voc\u00ea oculte determinadas pesquisas quando elas n\u00e3o forem necess\u00e1rias, como fazer @Pause , @Star , @Swimming e @Mode . Propriedades de valor link Ao usar objetos de pesquisa e formata\u00e7\u00e3o @object () , \u00e9 poss\u00edvel combinar e executar c\u00e1lculos. Isso pode ser usado para exibir corretamente uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o, em tempo de jogo, etc. ou fazer pesquisas mais avan\u00e7adas. Exemplo `@Score (0x28 * 10_0x29 * 1000_0x26 * 100000) points`` Isso significa usar a pesquisa ou pontua\u00e7\u00e3o de formato e dar a soma de: 0x28 vezes 10, ADD 0x29 vezes 1000, ADD 0x26 vezes 100000 _ adiciona os endere\u00e7os juntos. Ou voc\u00ea pode adicionar um valor est\u00e1tico 0x28_v10 . Isso adiciona 10 ao seu total, como em qualquer que seja o valor de 0x28 + 10 ser\u00e1 exibido. Voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m pode subtrair 0x28_v-10 . Se voc\u00ea quiser subtrair um endere\u00e7o, multiplique o endere\u00e7o por -1. 0x29 * -1 . 0x29 agora \u00e9 negativo. Se voc\u00ea gostaria de realizar a divis\u00e3o, voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 multiplicar por um decimal. 0x26 * .5 . 0x26 ir\u00e1 gerar 1/2 do valor em 0x26 . E voc\u00ea pode amarrar tudo junto: 0x28 * 10_0x29 * -1_0x26 * .625_v-10 . Voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m pode adicionar endere\u00e7os juntos para fornecer pesquisas com base nas somas de v\u00e1rios endere\u00e7os. Isso \u00e9 usado no exemplo em @Star. Est\u00e1 procurando a soma dos 6 bits mais baixos do endere\u00e7o 0xh79f.

To have RP in a game you need a Rich Presence Script (RPS) which is created by Developers. The Script checks the player's game memory and as programmed reports the values of certain addresses with definitions assigned by the Developer such as which stage the player is on, how many lives they have, if the game is paused, what game mode they are playing, what the player has accomplished, etc. This information is reported back to the website. Example of RP in action: To see the RP live in a game click on the RetroAchievements menu in your emulator and then click on Rich Presence Monitor. A small window will show you your active RP. (Good for debugging) The best way to understand Rich Presence is to look at various examples in game, look at the addresses used and look at how the text is displayed in the Rich Presence Monitor and on site. How Does it work? link Every time a game is launched, it fetches the achievements in a 'patch' file for the ROM which details all the achievements and memory addresses (and leaderboards) that can be watched for. It will also request a Rich Presence Script for the currently loaded ROM. The emulator will report back to the website every 120 seconds. Similarly, every 120 seconds or so, the 'active players' box on the front page will refresh, detailing the last known activity of all active players. If there isn't a rich presence script given, the text will be 'earning achievements' if playing a game with achievements, 'playing [game]' if playing a game without achievements, or 'developing achievements' if the memory dialog is open and visible. The RPS for each game can be found under the development section on each game's page: Example (Super Mario Bros.) link Format:Digit FormatType=VALUE Lookup:Mode 0=[Demo] 2=[World Complete] Lookup:Paused 0x81=\u258c\u258c 0x80=\u258c\u258c 1=\u258c\u258c Lookup:Star 5=\ud83c\udf1f 4=\ud83c\udf1f 3=\ud83c\udf1f 2=\ud83c\udf1f 1=\ud83c\udf1f Lookup:Powerup 0=Small 1=Super 2=Fire Lookup:Swimming 1= swimming Lookup:Status 0= [Loading] 1= taking a vine warp 2= entering a warp pipe 3= entering a warp pipe 4= \ud83d\udea9 5= [Stage Complete] 6= [Game Over] 7= [Entering Area] 9= growing 0xA= shrinking 0xB= \ud83d\udc80 0xC= powering up Lookup:Quest 0x0=1st 0x1=2nd Display: @Mode(0xh770)@Paused(0xh776)@Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f)@Powerup(0xh0756) Mario in @Digit(0xh75f_v1)-@Digit(0xh75c_v1)@Swimming(0xh704)@Status(0xhe), \ud83d\udeb6:@Digit(0xh75a_v1), @Quest(0xh7fc) Quest It breaks down into a series of Lookup objects, Format objects and one Display object. Lookups link Lookups are defined like this: Lookup:NameOfLookup Value1=Text When This Value Value2=Text When Another Value ... We give the Lookup a value, consisting of a series of memory addresses and modifiers. More about this later. Format link Format tables are defined like this: Format:Score FormatType=VALUE Begin with Format: , then the name of the format type. On the next line, give FormatType= , then one of the following: VALUE , SCORE (or POINTS ), TIME (or FRAMES ), SECS , MILLISECS , or OTHER . VALUE : generic value, no leading zeroes. SCORE / POINTS : generic value, padded with leading 0s to 6 digits. TIME / FRAMES : value describes the number of frames elapsed, and will be turned into 00:00.00 SECS : value describes the number of seconds elapsed, and will be turned into 00:00 MILLISECS : value describes the number of hundredths of a second elapsed, and will be turned into 00:00.00 MINUTES : value describes the number of minutes elapsed, and will be turned into 0h00 SECS_AS_MINS : value describes the number of seconds elapsed, and will be turned into 0h00 Display link Display will be a string that gets shown in the 'Active Players' box on the front page. It refers to the previously defined Lookup and Format objects using a single '@'. It then specifies a name for the lookup or format (case sensitive!), and immediately after, in brackets, a series of memory values specifying what to send to that lookup or format object. @Powerup(0xh756) This means use the Lookup or Format that's called Powerup , and give it whatever value is in 0xh756. Example Lookup Breakdown link @Mode(0xh770) - Lookup for the address that shows if the game is in demo mode or a world has been completed. @Paused(0xh776) - Lookup for the address that shows if the game is paused (3 values are used, two of them are for pausing and unpausing). @Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f) - Lookup for the address of if Mario has Star invincibility.

This time It's looking up the stage. World 1-X. @Swimming(0xh704) - Lookup for the address that shows if the player is swimming. @Status(0xhe) - Lookup for the address that shows Mario's status, such as going through pipes. , \ud83d\udeb6: - More static text. \ud83d\udeb6 is a symbol for lives. @Digit(0xh75a_v1) - Third use of the Digit format object. This time it's checking the player lives address. , - Static text. @Quest(0xh7fc) A lookup to see if the player is in normal or on the 2nd quest, hardmode. Quest - Static Text. Address size link To specify what size of address you are are checking there are various characters used. (capitalization is ignored) A 16bit address is default and has no character designation. At 0x10 the address is two bytes - 16 bits. An 8bit address's character is h (or H ). At 0xh10 the address is one byte - 8 bits. xxxx xxxx An upper4 address's character is u (or U ). At 0xu10 the address is one nibble - 4 bits. xxxx 0000 A lower4 address's character is l (or L ). At 0xl10 the address is one nibble - 4 bits. 0000 xxxx A bit0 address's character is m (or M ). At 0xm10 the address is one bit, the lowest bit: 0000 000x A bit1 address's character is n (or N ). At 0xn10 the address is one bit, the second bit: 0000 00x0 A bit2 address's character is o (or O ). At 0xo10 the address is one bit, the third bit: 0000 0x00 A bit3 address's character is p (or P ). At 0xp10 the address is one bit, the fourth bit: 0000 x000 A bit4 address's character is q (or Q ). At 0xq10 the address is one bit, the fifth bit: 000x 0000 A bit5 address's character is r (or R ). At 0xr10 the address is one bit, the sixth bit: 00x0 0000 A bit6 address's character is s (or S ). At 0xs10 the address is one bit, the seventh bit: 0x00 0000 A bit7 address's character is t (or T ). At 0xt10 the address is one bit, the top bit: x000 0000 A 32bit address's character is x (or X ). At 0xx10 the address is four bytes and 32 bits. A 24bit address's character is w (or W ). At 0xW10 the address three bytes and 24 bits. Summarizing on a table: location/size prefix (the letters can be in lower case) example bit0 0xM 0xM01234 bit1 0xN 0xN01234 bit2 0xO 0xO01234 bit3 0xP 0xP01234 bit4 0xQ 0xQ01234 bit5 0xR 0xR01234 bit6 0xS 0xS01234 bit7 0xT 0xT01234 Lower4 0xL 0xL01234 Upper4 0xU 0xU01234 8bit 0xH 0xH01234 16bit 0x 0x01234 24bit 0xW 0xW123 32bit 0xX 0xX01234 Conditional Display Strings link Display: ?0x 000085=0?Title Screen ?0xT00007c=1?Custom Map in @Landscape(0xH00016c) Playing Battle @Battle(0x 00007c*0.2) in @Landscape(0xH00016c) The existing Display: marker is still used to indicate the start of the display block. If the next line starts with a question mark, it is considered to be a conditional display string. The portion of the line between the two question marks is the conditional clause. If the conditional clause evaluates true, then the remaining portion of the line is used as the display string. If it does not evaluate true, then processing proceeds to the next line. If it starts with a question mark, the same process repeats. If it does not start with a question mark, the entire line is used as the default display string. NOTE : A default display string is required in case none of the conditional display strings match. If you only have conditional display strings, the script will appear to do nothing. Looking at this example, if the 16-bit value at $0085 is 0, the display string is Title Screen . If not, the next line is examined. If the 7th bit of $007C is 1, the display string is Custom Map in @Landscape(0xH00016c) . If not, the final line does not have a conditional clause and is used. Display strings associated with a conditional clause support all of the same syntax as the default display string. In this example, you can see the @Landscape lookup is used in both the conditional display string and the default display string. The lookup itself only has to be defined once. The conditional phrase supports all of the previously mentioned address accessors as well as AND (_) and OR (S) logic. Note that OR clauses still require a 'core' group, just like achievements . ?0xH1234=32_0xH2345=0?and example if the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 and the 8-bit value at $2345 is 0, display and example ?0xH1234=32S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?or example if the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 and the 8-bit value at $2345 is 1 or 2, display or example ?0xH1234=32_0xH5678=33S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?and/or example if the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 and the 8-bit value at $5678 is 33 and the 8-bit value at $2345 is 1 or 2, display and/or example Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) link BCD is when the values are store in an address from as 0-9 (one digit) or 0-99 (two digits). Keep in mind that most often values are stored in hexidecimal, but sometime games will store them in this way and here's the best way to handle these addresses in your display. BCD decoding treats each hex character as a decimal digit. If the memory inspector shows 86 (in hex), the result of BCD decoding the value would be 86 (in decimal). For value objects you can use the BCD prefix, as in b0xh1234 . This also works with leaderboard values . Note that you still need to specify the size of the BCD memory address. b0x1234 reads a 16-bit value. b0xh1234 reads an 8-bit value and b0xX1234 reads a 32-bit value. NOTE : Support for 16-bit and 32-bit BCD decoding is a feature of the 0.075 toolkit. This is most commonly used for score and time, but often other types of display values. Limits link 65,535 character limit for script 255 character limit for what is displayed Unicode characters are allowed, some use more characters than 1 Syntax Details link Lookup keys are decimal by default and hex if you place the prefix of 0x . This mean 1 == 0x1 , 2 == 0x2 , 9 == 0x9 , 10 == 0xa , 100 == 0x64 , etc. Lookup/Format names are case specific and must exactly match the usage in the Display string: @test(0x1234) will not find \"Format:Test\" Lookup/Format cannot contain spaces before or after the lookup name. @test(0x1234) will not find \"Format:test \" or \"Format: test\" If your Lookup/Format cannot be found, nothing will be displayed. This is a @test(0x1234). will result in This is a . if test cannot be found. Comments can be added anywhere in the script. A double slash ( // ) indicates the remaining portion of the line should be ignored when processing the script. Note: comments still apply toward the script size limit. Tips and Tricks link Lookup names can be as short as a single character if you need to squeeze in a few extra characters. Leading zeros can be removed from addresses ( 0xh0001 can be shortened to 0xh1 ). Turning all your values from hex into decimal will take up less characters. Unicode characters don't always \"take up less space\" they often take up to four system characters. If a lookup doesn't contain a mapping for a value, it will result in a blank (no space) value. You can change this behavior by adding a single line to the lookup mapping '*' to the desired fallback value. Each Lookup or Format named mapping can be referenced multiple times with the same or different addresses. You can define a single Format:Number FormatType=VALUE instead of defining individual ones for Lives, Score, Level, etc. Putting spaces in your lookups sometimes before or after can allow you to hide certain lookups when they are not needed, like how @Pause , @Star , @Swimming , and @Mode do. Value Properties link When using lookup and format objects @object() it's possible to combine and perform calculations. This can be used to correctly display a score, in game time, etc. or make more advanced lookups. Example @Score(0x28*10_0x29*1000_0x26*100000) points This means use the Lookup or Format Score , and give it the sum of: - 0x28 times 10, ADD - 0x29 times 1000, ADD - 0x26 times 100000 _ adds the addresses together. Or you can add a static value 0x28_v10 . This adds 10 to your total, as in whatever the value of 0x28 + 10 will be displayed. You can also subtract 0x28_v-10. If you'd like to subtract an address you need to multiply the address by -1. 0x29*-1 . 0x29 is now negative. If you'd like to perform division you'll need to multiply by a decimal. 0x26*.5 . 0x26 will output 1/2 of the value at 0x26 . And you can string everything together: 0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10 . You can also add addresses together to give you lookups based on the sums of various addresses. This is used in the example in @Star. It's looking up sum the 6 lowest bits of the address 0xh79f. The way this address works is that so long as there is a value there Mario is invincible star mario and it counts down from hex value 0x23 (35 decimal) to 0. 23 in binary is 0010 0011 meaning the max sum of these bits could 5 during 0001 1111 when the count down reaches hex value 0x1f (31 decimal). Unicode Standard Symbols link You can without doubt use these symbols in rich presence. \u258c\u258c=Paused \ud83d\udd01=Continues \u23f0=In Game Time/Game Clock \ud83d\udd11=Keys \ud83d\udca3=Bombs \u2764\ufe0f or \u2764=In a game with hearts (e.g. Zelda) \ud83d\udcb0=Money \ud83d\udea9=Level/Stage While making Rich Presence devs need to be careful that they are communicating clearly. If you are using non-standard symbols they will make sense to you but could be entirely confusing to others. When using non-standard symbols, check them with someone else or a few people to see if the symbols you use make sense. If they don't, use better symbols, use text or use symbols alongside of text. For custom unicode/emoji ShapeCatcher is an excellent resource, you can draw what you're looking for and an AI will find similar matches. Just be careful to not use unicode that too obscure , as they don't all display on all systems. Take note of community display preference: Developing Rich Presence link The toolkit does not currently have an integrated Rich Presence editor, but you can test local changes before putting them on the server. Once you've started a game and the current Rich Presence has been downloaded from the server, you can find it in RACache\\Data\\XXX-Rich.txt where XXX is the game ID. The Rich Presence Monitor (openable from the RetroAchievments menu) reads this file and shows the current value every second while the window is open. If you make changes to the XXX-Rich.txt file, and reselect the menu option, it will read the new changes and allow you to immediate test them without applying the changes to the server. Continue to make changes and reselect the menu option until the script is behaving as you expect, then copy the contents to the server page to make it available to everyone else. NOTE : The XXX-Rich.txt file is overwritten with the current server data each time the game is opened. As long as you still have the file open in an editor, you can always save your changes over the updated file after reopening the game. Parse Errors link Code Enum Description -2 INVALID_MEMORY_OPERAND A memory operand was expected and not found. Memory operands start with 0x , then a size indicator. The most common causes of this are forgetting the 0x or having an _S or __ in the script. -3 INVALID_CONST_OPERAND A lookup key could not be evaluated. The most common cause of this is using hex without the 0x prefix -6 INVALID_OPERATOR An unknown operator was encountered. The most common cause of this is using ! instead of != -16 MISSING_VALUE A macro was encountered without providing a value (i.e. @Points instead of @Points(0xh1234) ) -18 MISSING_DISPLAY_STRING The rich presence script did not contain a Display: element, or contained only conditional display strings -20 RC_INVALID_VALUE_FLAG A non-combining flag is used in a non-trigger context. Combining flags are AddSource, SubSource, AddHits, AddAddress and AndNext. Additionally, if you see [Unknown macro] , that means the macro name could not be resolved. For example @Points(0xh1234) without defining Format:Points would generate [Unknown macro]Points(0xh1234) . This issue happens sometimes when a Rich Presence is created in the <GameID>-Rich.txt file in the RACache>Data folder. In this case the issue can be fixed by adding an empty line at the start of the file.

If the next line starts with a question mark, it is considered to be a conditional display string. The portion of the line between the two question marks is the conditional clause. If the conditional clause evaluates true, then the remaining portion of the line is used as the display string. If it does not evaluate true, then processing proceeds to the next line. If it starts with a question mark, the same process repeats. If it does not start with a question mark, the entire line is used as the default display string. NOTE : A default display string is required in case none of the conditional display strings match. If you only have conditional display strings, the script will appear to do nothing. Looking at this example, if the 16-bit value at $0085 is 0, the display string is Title Screen . If not, the next line is examined. If the 7th bit of $007C is 1, the display string is Custom Map in @Landscape(0xH00016c) . If not, the final line does not have a conditional clause and is used. Display strings associated with a conditional clause support all of the same syntax as the default display string. In this example, you can see the @Landscape lookup is used in both the conditional display string and the default display string. The lookup itself only has to be defined once. The conditional phrase supports all of the previously mentioned address accessors as well as AND (_) and OR (S) logic. Note that OR clauses still require a 'core' group, just like achievements . ?0xH1234=32_0xH2345=0?and example if the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 and the 8-bit value at $2345 is 0, display and example ?0xH1234=32S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?or example if the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 and the 8-bit value at $2345 is 1 or 2, display or example ?0xH1234=32_0xH5678=33S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?and/or example if the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 and the 8-bit value at $5678 is 33 and the 8-bit value at $2345 is 1 or 2, display and/or example","title":"Conditional Display Strings"},{"location":"Rich-Presence/#binary-coded-decimal-bcd","text":"BCD is when the values are store in an address from as 0-9 (one digit) or 0-99 (two digits). Keep in mind that most often values are stored in hexidecimal, but sometime games will store them in this way and here's the best way to handle these addresses in your display. BCD decoding treats each hex character as a decimal digit. If the memory inspector shows 86 (in hex), the result of BCD decoding the value would be 86 (in decimal). For value objects you can use the BCD prefix, as in b0xh1234 . This also works with leaderboard values . Note that you still need to specify the size of the BCD memory address. b0x1234 reads a 16-bit value. b0xh1234 reads an 8-bit value and b0xX1234 reads a 32-bit value. NOTE : Support for 16-bit and 32-bit BCD decoding is a feature of the 0.075 toolkit. This is most commonly used for score and time, but often other types of display values.","title":"Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)"},{"location":"Rich-Presence/#limits","text":"65,535 character limit for script 255 character limit for what is displayed Unicode characters are allowed, some use more characters than 1","title":"Limits"},{"location":"Rich-Presence/#syntax-details","text":"Lookup keys are decimal by default and hex if you place the prefix of 0x . This mean 1 == 0x1 , 2 == 0x2 , 9 == 0x9 , 10 == 0xa , 100 == 0x64 , etc. Lookup/Format names are case specific and must exactly match the usage in the Display string: @test(0x1234) will not find \"Format:Test\" Lookup/Format cannot contain spaces before or after the lookup name. @test(0x1234) will not find \"Format:test \" or \"Format: test\" If your Lookup/Format cannot be found, nothing will be displayed. This is a @test(0x1234). will result in This is a . if test cannot be found. Comments can be added anywhere in the script. A double slash ( // ) indicates the remaining portion of the line should be ignored when processing the script. Note: comments still apply toward the script size limit.","title":"Syntax Details"},{"location":"Rich-Presence/#tips-and-tricks","text":"Lookup names can be as short as a single character if you need to squeeze in a few extra characters. Leading zeros can be removed from addresses ( 0xh0001 can be shortened to 0xh1 ). Turning all your values from hex into decimal will take up less characters. Unicode characters don't always \"take up less space\" they often take up to four system characters. If a lookup doesn't contain a mapping for a value, it will result in a blank (no space) value. You can change this behavior by adding a single line to the lookup mapping '*' to the desired fallback value. Each Lookup or Format named mapping can be referenced multiple times with the same or different addresses. You can define a single Format:Number FormatType=VALUE instead of defining individual ones for Lives, Score, Level, etc. Putting spaces in your lookups sometimes before or after can allow you to hide certain lookups when they are not needed, like how @Pause , @Star , @Swimming , and @Mode do.","title":"Tips and Tricks"},{"location":"Rich-Presence/#value-properties","text":"When using lookup and format objects @object() it's possible to combine and perform calculations. This can be used to correctly display a score, in game time, etc. or make more advanced lookups. Example @Score(0x28*10_0x29*1000_0x26*100000) points This means use the Lookup or Format Score , and give it the sum of: - 0x28 times 10, ADD - 0x29 times 1000, ADD - 0x26 times 100000 _ adds the addresses together. Or you can add a static value 0x28_v10 . This adds 10 to your total, as in whatever the value of 0x28 + 10 will be displayed. You can also subtract 0x28_v-10. If you'd like to subtract an address you need to multiply the address by -1. 0x29*-1 . 0x29 is now negative. If you'd like to perform division you'll need to multiply by a decimal. 0x26*.5 . 0x26 will output 1/2 of the value at 0x26 . And you can string everything together: 0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10 . You can also add addresses together to give you lookups based on the sums of various addresses. This is used in the example in @Star. It's looking up sum the 6 lowest bits of the address 0xh79f. The way this address works is that so long as there is a value there Mario is invincible star mario and it counts down from hex value 0x23 (35 decimal) to 0. 23 in binary is 0010 0011 meaning the max sum of these bits could 5 during 0001 1111 when the count down reaches hex value 0x1f (31 decimal).","title":"Value Properties"},{"location":"Rich-Presence/#unicode-standard-symbols","text":"You can without doubt use these symbols in rich presence. \u258c\u258c=Paused \ud83d\udd01=Continues \u23f0=In Game Time/Game Clock \ud83d\udd11=Keys \ud83d\udca3=Bombs \u2764\ufe0f or \u2764=In a game with hearts (e.g. Zelda) \ud83d\udcb0=Money \ud83d\udea9=Level/Stage While making Rich Presence devs need to be careful that they are communicating clearly.

In this we want to make sure the player went through all levels to beat the game in order to earn the achievement. If the player uses a save state to go directly to the last stage and finish it, the achievement won't pop up. Addresses 0x06e9 : level ID. From 0 to 8 and 8 means \"finished the game\". Conditions In the \"game finished level\". The level was increased 8 times. Reset the counter if the level decreases. As this game has 8 levels, the value in the level ID address must be increased 8 times to beat the game. This way a player can't just start the game, load a state to go directly to the last level and then beat the game. He/she needs to go through all levels. The ResetIf is here just to avoid the case where the player keep loading states going back and forth between levels making the hit counter to be 8. If he/she loads a state going to a lower level, the hit counter goes to zero. NOTE: Load State abuse is currently only an issue in RetroArch. In the standalone emulators, the hit counts are persisted with the save state, so they can't be arbitrarily manipulated as described below. In both RetroArch and the standalone emulators, save states cannot be loaded in hardcore, which further limits the impact of abuse. If your achievement misfires when using load states, we won't hold it against you but you may receive tickets. Just be aware of the problem and if you can attribute the failure to using load states and confirm the user was using load states, you can close the ticket with \"Another Reason\" and detail why you believe its related to using load states. Applying a solution similar to the one above also protects against cheat codes or passwords where the user might skip right to the last level. Use your best judgment when deciding how much effort you want to apply in adding logic like this to your sets. It's much more important that the set functions appropriately in hardcore mode (where you cannot load states). You should still protect against cheat codes, passwords, and in-game saves.

A si que, no es obligatoria para desarrolladores jr. (jr-devs). El SubSource puede ser seleccionado en la columba de Bandera (Flag) en el Editor de Logros (Achievement Editor) Funciona similarmente a Add Source , pero una bandera Sub Source convierte el valor en memoria en un valor negativo. Nota 1 : Sub Source NO es una bandera de subtraccion. Solo convierte el valor en negativo. Nota 2 : La ultima linea (sin el Add Source o Sub Source ) aun se agrega a la comparativa final (Es una condicion que se tiene que cumplir). Utlizando este ejemplo de uso de un AddSource , si lo remplazamos con un Sub Source y con los mismos valores ( valor(0x8010) = 1 and valor(0x8020) = 2 ), la comparacion seria -1 + 2 > 0 , o 1 > 0 . Utilizando SubSource para Contar Incrementos Especificos link SubSource tambien puede ser utilizado para rastrear incrementos especificos en una variable. La condicion que se muestra abajo dice que el actual valor en la variable 0x0080dc menos el valor en el antiguo fotograma (Delta Frame) en la misma direccion deberia de ser igual a 2 . Efectivamente, esto significa que la condicion es verdadera cualquier vez que el valor en 0x0080dc se incremente exactamente sobre dos. Buscando un resultado negativo link Si el resultado en tu operacion con Sub Source es un numero negativo, es posible buscarlo. A si es como se representan los numeros negativos: -1 es 0xFFFFFFFF -2 es 0xFFFFFFFE -3 es 0xFFFFFFFD -4 es 0xFFFFFFFC -5 es 0xFFFFFFFB -6 es 0xFFFFFFFA -7 es 0xFFFFFFF9 y asi sucesivamente... A si que, vamos a decir que quieres buscar si el valor(0x8010) = 1 menos el valor(0x8020) = 2 es igual a -1 . Asi es como le harias: Esto significa -2 + 1 = -1 , que es verdad. Avanzado : tambien es posible utilizar directamente numeros negativos en la columna de la izquierda con tus operaciones Sub/Add Source. Para hacerlo, recuerda cambiar el Tipo (Type) de Mem a Value , y utilizar los valores explicados arriba, como 0xFFFFFFE5 para -27 , y 0xFFFFFFE3 para -29 , por ejemplo: Esto significa -2 + (-27) = -29 , que es -2 - 27 = -29 , el cual es cierto. De todos modos ten cuidado, si utilizas numeros negativos en una bandera con Sub Source, va a resultar en un doble negativo, convirtiendo los numeros de nuevo a positivos. Hecha un vistazo: Esto significa - (-2) + (-27) = -29 , que es 2 - 27 = -29 , que es -25 = -29 , el cual es falso.

Note 1 : Sub Source is NOT a subtraction flag. It just makes the value be negative. Note 2 : The final line (without Add Source or Sub Source ) is still added for the final comparison. Using that AddSource usecase example , if we replaced it with the Sub Source and with the same values ( value(0x8010) = 1 and value(0x8020) = 2 ), the comparison would be -1 + 2 > 0 , or 1 > 0 . Using SubSource to Count Specific Increments link SubSource can also be used to track specific increases in addresses. The conditions below states that the current value in address 0x0080dc less the value in the previous frame in the same address must be equal 2 . Effectively, this means that the condition is true whenever the value in address 0x0080dc increases by exactly two. Checking for a negative result link If the result of your Sub Source operation is a negative number, it is possible to check for it. This is how negative numbers are represented: -1 is 0xFFFFFFFF -2 is 0xFFFFFFFE -3 is 0xFFFFFFFD -4 is 0xFFFFFFFC -5 is 0xFFFFFFFB -6 is 0xFFFFFFFA -7 is 0xFFFFFFF9 and so on... So, let's say you want to check if value(0x8010) = 1 minus value(0x8020) = 2 equals -1 . This is how you would do it: This means -2 + 1 = -1 , which is true. Advanced : it is also possible to use straight negative numbers in the left section of your Sub/Add Source operations. To do so, remember to change the Type from Mem to Value , and use the values as explained above, such as 0xFFFFFFE5 for -27 , and 0xFFFFFFE3 for -29 , for example: This means -2 + (-27) = -29 , which is -2 - 27 = -29 , which is true. Take care, though, if you use a straight negative number in a Sub Source flag, it will result in a double negative, turning the number back to positive. Take a look: This means - (-2) + (-27) = -29 , which is 2 - 27 = -29 , which is -25 = -29 , which is false.

With the recent announcement of a PS2 core , there have been a lot of questions regarding if/when it will be supported. If you're only interested in the answer to that question, skip to the end of this article . But if you want to understand what exactly is needed to add support for a new system, keep reading. Requirements link These are the things that are required in order to add RetroAchievements support for a new system: Emulation (preferably a libretro core). The core must expose memory. The core must function in RALibretro. Unique identification of games. Server support. Step 1: Emulation link The first step is, obviously, to have an emulator for the system to be supported. In the early days of RetroAchievements we used standalone emulators - one for each system. Keeping all those emulators bug-free and up-to-date requires a lot of effort and we don't have enough programmers involved on this front. It's currently preferred to use a libretro core for emulation. This way the core developers can push new features and we can focus only on the achievement functionality. Cores can be updated and released without any additional effort for us. Another big advantage is that libretro cores also function in RetroArch , which allows RetroAchievements to be earned on many platforms (the standalone emulators were all Windows-only applications). Managed by : libretro core developers. Step 1a: Exposed Memory link As achievement triggers are a series of conditions that watch for things that happen in the emulated RAM, another requirement is access to the system's RAM. Without exposed memory, the Memory Inspector appears blank and achievement creators are unable to create achievements. Additionally, as RetroAchievements only reads the memory once per frame, some systems which heavily leverage paged memory have to provide some way to access the entire memory, not just the current page of memory. Managed by : libretro core developers with some interaction with RetroAchievements developers. Step 1b: RALibretro link The core must function in RALibretro, as that is where the achievement developers will identify the important pieces of memory and create the achievements. This is usually only an issue if the core relies on some functionality not yet implemented in RALibretro (like the recently added keyboard and OpenGL 3D support), but some issues are caused by the RALibretro implementation being sufficiently different from the RetroArch implementation. Unless the core can be modified to not require the missing functionality, it cannot be supported until RALibretro is updated. This page lists the status of each core the last time they were tested. Managed by : RetroAchievements Step 2: Game Identification link We must be able to uniquely identify the games for the system. We use a method called MD5 , which scans the game's file and generates a number that we usually call as \"hash\". With this number it's possible to confirm if two copies of a file are identical, which makes it possible to ensure the player is using a ROM that the achievements were designed or tested against. For most systems, we are able to just hash the entire ROM file, minus any header information. For larger games (particularly those on CD or DVD) we only hash what we consider to be the most important data to minimize load times. More information on how we identify games can be found here . For systems with writable media (mostly home computers), we have to make sure that we don't hash any files that may be modified by the game itself. Systems that write to the game file must treat the original disk file as readonly and only write changes to a copy of the disk. If the core/emulator modifies the disk file, it can no longer be identified and cannot be considered viable for achievements. Managed by : RetroAchievements Step 3: Configure the Web Server link In order to support a new system, the RetroAchievements web server must be properly configured to accept new game and achievement entries for that system. Managed by : RetroAchievements When will RA support PlayStation 2? link Regarding PS2 support on RetroAchievements, the libretro team is still working on the PCSX2 core .

This is fairly common, as many games of the 16-bit era still had 'attract modes', and is usually a pretty easy thing to fix with the achievements. We are looking in the game to find something that is set when the game is in a demo mode. Either a small piece of memory set to 0 , or 1 , or 0xff . It could be anything really. To start it will help to play through the game a little, and set a few save states throughout different levels of the game. And then to begin finding this 'is demo mode active' memory, we should first reset the game and wait for the demo to play. During when the game plays the first demo, use the Memory Inspector to start a new 8-bit test, (click New 8-bit test ), and set the filter value to be equal to the last known value (under Filter values: , set to == ), and press Filter! a few times. With each press, you should see the number of matches slowly become fewer, but not by much. Next wait til the game starts playing another demo but on a different level. When the next demo is playing, press Filter a few more times, and you'll see the candidates get smaller again. Continue to do this until you've eliminated as many candidates as you can. IMPORTANT : Don't forget, you only want to press filter when the game is DEFINITELY in the demo. If you press when it's on the title screen, or playing a movie, or even when fading in or out, the value might not be set. There's no real way to know; we are assuming that it will be set (or unset) when the demo itself is playing, which itself is only a fairly likely assumption. After viewing some or all of the demos, you will probably still have TONS of potential memory values. Here's the juicy part, that should eliminate a ton of candidates at once. Load up one of your save states where you are definitely in-game, playing and NOT in a demo. Now we will be filtering for \"I am NOT in a demo\". Set your filter value to not-equal != , and hit Filter ONLY ONCE . At this point, the set of candidates now represent memory values that are \"values different to when a demo was playing\". Switch back to equal (=), and hit Filter a few more times (because we are saying 'whatever values we have, they are the same as the ones just now. The 'is demo mode' value will still be equivalent to whatever it was just now). It might help to move the character around the screen, or perform a few actions, between hitting the Filter button. Next, load up your next save state, and perform the same routine. Your number of candidates should reduce further, until you have less than 100 remaining. By now if you should have only a few candidates remaining. Likely values for the candidate will be 0, 1 or 0xff. If it is something else I'd recommend ignoring it, as it's not likely to be what we're looking for (but still, not impossible). For example, in Sonic the Hedgehog (Mega Drive) , the address is 0xfff0, and the value is 01 when a demo is active. Our next step will be to verify our find. Pick one of these values and restart the game, keeping an eye on this value as the game plays the demos. Then load through each of your save states and see if it changes as you expect it to. Perhaps start a brand new game and see if it matches up correctly to the value it is when the other save states are active. Make a note of the value it is when the game is active. Let's say we are pretty confident we've found the memory used to say 'game is in demo mode'. We'll save this to CodeNotes by adding a description in the Memory Inspector, then clicking Add Note . Next we will use the Achievements dialog to find all the achievements that could unlock during the demos (probably all the level-based achievements), and add a new requirement to these achievements. Add it alongside the existing requirements. For this new requirement, set the address to the 'demo mode active' memory we found, set the mem size to 8-bit, and set the value we require to be equal to the value when the game is active. That's it! Now the achievement will only trigger if the player is on a certain level, AND that the game is not in a demo mode! Before we commit this back to the server, it's a good idea to test out this to see if it worked. Press ESC on the game to bring up the overlay and pause the game. Then click 'Reset Achieved Status' on this achievement in the 'Achievements' dialog, and confirm the prompt. Finally, click back in the game and press TAB to reset the game, and ESC to dismiss the overlay. Press F4 a few times to increase the speed of the game, and watch to ensure the achievement doesn't trigger. If it still triggers, it sounds like something went wrong. Try and check the requirements are entered correctly ('is demo mode' comparison probably needs to be '8-bit'), check that you reset the right achievement, and finally watch the value of the 'is demo mode' flag in the memory inspector. If it worked correctly, select the achievement in the Achievements dialog, hit 'Commit Selected', confirm the dialog and you're done! There are many alternative methods for getting the 'is demo mode' flag, but unfortunately none of them are guarantees. All I can do is suggest methods I've found in existing games. To start with, I'll suggest Castlevania: Bloodlines (Mega Drive) , and the achievement Watery Grave (5) . There is a mild cheat-protection in these requirements, but I'll just focus on the 'demo mode' part. Castlevania treats every screen as a type of 'screen mode'. To test for this, I started the game, and at the sega logo, I started an 8-bit test. I then assumed that the 'screen mode' would have changed by the time it was playing the 'intro movie', so I did a 'not equal', then an 'equal' filter to suggest that I only want candidates that have changed. I did this again at the 'press start' screen, then at the options screen, then the password screen, character select screen, and finally ingame. By this point I had 10 matches. I mentally eliminated anything where the surrounding values were very random - this data is likely to be graphic or sound data, and won't be much use for us. After having repeated the test and watching each of these 10 values, I also eliminated a few more, as some of these appeared to change while I was still on the same screen. This left me with three values, 0x9002 , 0x9004 and 0x905e . After going into game and playing for a few seconds, I could tell that 0x905e was changing while I was still ingame. I opted to use 0x9002 , as it was located fairly close to clean boundary ( 0x9000 ). Also values like this are likely to be in the second half of RAM (between 0x8000 and 0xffff ) as they are easier for developers to address.","title":"Testing for Demo Mode"},{"location":"The-Cheevo-Workshop/","text":"The Cheevo Workshop link This page is a work in progress. Guidelines are not final; we're still getting kinks worked out. Details link The Cheevo Workshop is an ongoing open achievement development project where anyone can get involved and everyone has a say in the creation of a chosen game's achievement set. The goal of the project is to promote collaboration between developers, help jr-devs raise their proficiency, motivate former/retired developers into becoming active again by taking on smaller roles, and to encourage users to try out achievement development. If you are not a developer, you can still contribute by submitting ideas, designing badges, testing for bugs in unofficial, etc. If you wish to participate in the workshop, request the @workshop role from an admin or a mod. Rules link One set at a time! Adhere to the Developer's Code of Conduct. The game picked for each workshop cannot be reserved by a developer at the time it is chosen. Do not make yourself hard to work with. Go into the workshop with an open mind. Do not get greedy about credit and do not try to 'hog the set.' Once contribution credits are implemented, they will be put to good use here. In the meantime, specific credits will be stated on Discord and the game's forum thread. When and if you decide to participate, announce how you'd like to contribute and present your findings and progress. This is to prevent participants from overlapping on tasks. This is especially important for tasks where overwriting someone else's work can occur (i.e. code notes). A set lead should be voted on by workshop participants. The set lead is responsible for maintaining a development schedule (aka due dates). MIA users should not stall a set's progress. This is not a competition. Use the workshop to build a good set, to help others, and to learn. Workshop Checklist link This is a general road map for a set's development cycle when being developed by the workshop. Whenever a step of the Workshop Checklist is underway, it should be represented in the topic of the #workshop channel. 1. Voting link This is when a game undergoing the workshop treatment is decided on. * Announcements should be made in the #community-news channel and pinging the @event-news role. * The first ten suggestions will be put up for a vote. * Polls can be submitted in the #poll-me channel for the widest reach. * Allow a 24-hour voting period, but do not use timed polls until ghost voting can be dealt with. * Be sure to research each game, mostly to see if a set has already been reserved or not. 2. Team Building, Research, Digging, Planning link Once a game has been selected, the workshop can begin their work immediately. The following should take place during this step: * Form a team. Someone may request to be the set lead to guide the development process. If there are disputes on who is the set lead, a vote among workshop participants shall decide who ultimately gets the role. * Edit the game page to make sure all information, screenshots, box art, etc. are accurate. * Set reservation on the game's forum thread. This post is to be made by CheevoWorkshop , so it will require an admin's approval. Participants should be listed. An example of a CheevoWorkshop post can be found here. * Check gamefaqs, tcrf.net, gamehacking.org, YouTube, etc. Present any interesting discoveries that can be utilized for the achievement set. * Take turns finding memory addresses and values for anything that's noteworthy. \"Taking turns\" should be stressed here. Announce on the #workshop channel that you will be doing some RAM digging and also announce when you finish or are taking a break. This will allow others to resume digging without saving over any of your findings. * As a group, brainstorm a potential achievement list. These can be kept track of by using Google Sheets, an up-to-date pinned message, etc. * Check to see if design ideas are possible. 3. Set Development link Once an achievement list is created and a sufficient amount of addresses have been found, actual set development can occur. Consistency is very important here. Please note that nothing should be uploaded to Unofficial during this step. * The set lead may split the set up among the participating developers. * Agree on logic that is used. * Achievements should be tested locally. Issues that arise should be discussed in the #workshop channel. This will inform other participants of potential issues as well as lead to possible solutions. 4. Final Draft, Information, Protection, Badges link Agree upon and post a final draft of the achievement plan. If applicable, decide how to split up the uploads into unofficial. A lot of 'obvious' achievements such as progress and collectibles can be split up between participants. The easiest way to do this is to split them up evenly, but if there's any left over, they can be uploaded by the CheevoWorkshop user or set lead. Come up with names, descriptions, and badges for each achievement. Properly allocate the points. Add password, cheat, and/or save protection. Add leaderboards and/or rich presence. 5. Unofficial, Testing, Fixes link Push the set to Unofficial. Help each other test the achievements and find holes in the logic. Asking for volunteers who will play differently than the developers is not 100% necessary, but desirable. Improve stability. Editing another user's work must be announced beforehand with a screenshot of the work you intend to edit and why the edit is necessary. Verify alternate hashes, harmless hacks, etc. 6. Core, Tickets, Feedback, Cooldown link Push the set to core and make an announcement. Whoever takes credit for an achievement will be responsible for potential tickets. Be sure to fix them. Announce fixes in #workshop in cases the fixes would apply to achievements uploaded by other users. There should be a cooldown period after each set. This is to deal with any initial tickets and to discuss potential submissions for the next workshop. Other Information link This is the bot command that was used for the first poll (note there are only 8 because there were only 8 legit suggestions): !poll 'Please select one of the following for the workshop:' 'Pokemon Trading Card Game 2 (GBC) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/3692>' 'Kirby Tilt n Tumble (GBC) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/709>' 'Gekido Advance - Kintaros Revenge (GBA) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/7217>' 'Devil World (NES) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/4759>' 'James Pond - Underwater Agent (Mega Drive) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/2449>' 'Yu-Gi-Oh!

Empieza con la vista de 8-bit en el Visor de Memoria. Buscar pedazos grandes de memoria solo complica las cosas, pero har\u00eda un trabajo mas f\u00e1cil para un desarrollador experimentado. Si tu estas empezando y no estas consciente de t\u00e9rminos como endianess y bit ordering (o cuando los ojos est\u00e1n cansados), es mejor hacer observaciones usando la vista de 8-bit. Es simplemente mas f\u00e1cil! Desmarca la casilla \"Show Decimal Values\" en el Editor de Logros (Achievement Editor) para as\u00ed poder introducir los valores hex que encuentres en el Visor de Memoria (Memory Viewer). Es mejor que estar utilizando una calculadora de programador! Si encuentras una variable, tambi\u00e9n busca en los alrededores de la misma podr\u00edas encontrar muchas variables utiles. Puedes introducir valores en el Visor de Memoria para ver si afectan al juego. Incluso si algo esta visiblemente decrementando en el juego, como la vida, la memoria podr\u00eda tener diferencias. Podr\u00eda ser posible que este incluso incrementando, as\u00ed que como es algo de lo que no estas del todo seguro, es preferible que utilices los filtros != y = . Si tu absolutamente no puedes reducir los resultados de un filtro, puedes intentar adivinar algunos valores o m\u00ednimo como esta actuando ese valor ( > o < ). Por ejemplo, cero vida es usualmente 0 , Stage 1 es usualmente el valor 0 , Stage 2 es usualmente el valor 1 dependiendo el tipo de juego. Vista de 16/32 bit : Recuerda que cuando trabajas con variables de 16 o 32 bit las variables de la derecha son primero. Por Ejemplo: si en 8bit se mira de esta manera AB CD WX YZ , en 16 bit se convierte en CDAB YZWX . A esto se le llama \" ordenado de bits big endian \". Sin preocupaciones puedes ignorar esta platica geek, solamente recordando que las cosas se almacenan al rev\u00e9s en la vista de 16 bit y superiores. Bit fields : Utiliza single bits para cosas que solamente cambian en un bit. En el Inspector de Memoria (Memory Inspector), cuando una variable es seleccionada, vas a encontrar Bits: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 arriba de las variables. Y abajo de esos n\u00fameros va a ver ya sea un 0 o un 1 , as\u00ed como 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 en la imagen de abajo. Si bit5 tiene un 1 arriba de el, entonces bit3=1 para esa variable. El uso de Single bit es muy com\u00fan en un juego para items/eventos/desbloqueos/etc. Tal vez suene un poco confuso , pero es muy importante que lo entiendas. Algunos juegos con espacio en memoria muy limite usan los campos de bits (Bit fields) much\u00edsimo! Es una t\u00e9cnica importante de aprender. Tips en la Creaci\u00f3n de Logros link Tambi\u00e9n mira: Conceptos No-Bievenidos y Dise\u00f1o de Logros . Nunca Evita utilizar solo una condici\u00f3n lo mas que puedas . Cuando utilizas solo una condici\u00f3n el logro es muy probable que salga en el momento equivocado. Este es el error mas com\u00fan de un desarrollador . Si el juego tiene un modo demo (El CPU juega despu\u00e9s que hubieras esperado un tiempo en la pantalla de titulo), percatate de buscar la variable para ello y agrega la condicion para que tus logros no salgan en modo demo. Tal vez necesites saber como se utiliza un PauseIf y ResetIf . PauseIf cheat codes : Si el juego tiene un cheat code para incrementar vidas, seleccionar stages, etc. Percatate de encontrar las variables para ello y agregar alguna especie de protecci\u00f3n a tus logros. Si quieres crear un logro para colecciona un \u00edtem \u00fanico y especifico en el juego, agrega algunas condiciones para asegurarte que el jugador consigui\u00f3 el \u00edtem donde se supone que se tiene que conseguir, como en este ejemplo de aqu\u00ed . De otra manera podr\u00eda saltar utilizando un password, cargando un archivo de guardado, etc. Condiciones \u00d3 : si necesitas condiciones \u00d3, vas a necesitar Alt groups . Evita el exceso de Logros . Si un juego tiene 100 levels, no hagas un logro por cada nivel. Haz cada 25 o parecido. Considera el tiempo en el que un jugador casual podr\u00eda desbloquear esos logros. Si generalmente puedes desbloquear todos los logros de un set de progreso en medio hora y siendo un jugador casual, eso es dise\u00f1o de puro relleno, y no es recomendable. Se Creativo y Divertido : Se lo mas creativo posible con tus logros. \"Vence a X sin utilizar/hacer Y\", \"Vence a X en 5 segundos\", \"p\u00e1sate el juego con solo 3 corazones\". Ten en mente que incluso el jugador casual puede sacarse todos los logros si pone su mejor esfuerzo. No es divertido para un jugador casual si es demasiado dif\u00edcil! (Mira: Tips para Sets Bonus mas abajo para retos de verdad!). Hay una pagina completa sobre Dise\u00f1o de Logros hay puedes conseguir buenas ideas para pensar en como hacer buenos logros. Glitchless, por favor! : No hagas logros donde requieras el uso de glitches. Glitches, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, corrompen y destabilizan la RAM y memoria del juego. Para agregar b\u00e1sicamente rompen todo el set de logros. Por eso es, sabio agregar protecci\u00f3n a esto para as\u00ed detener a los jugadores de utilizarlos y conseguir los logros f\u00e1cilmente. Evita utilizar solamente texto y gr\u00e1ficas : La mayor\u00eda de las veces, un logro que requiere que pase cierto evento especial puede estar atado a una event flag (usualmente un single bit or byte), o a un objeto recibido por el jugador. Es mucho mejor utilizar estos valores que utilizar el ID de texto que se muestra en la caja de texto, o, mucho peor, RAM de v\u00eddeo (memoria atada a los gr\u00e1ficos que se muestran en pantalla) ya que muchas veces son menos estables. Especialmente en versiones diferentes del juego, y son mas dif\u00edciles de trabajar. Amamos el Arte : Badges bonitos son badges que dan gusto conseguir! Tiene que representar visualmente el logro en si, o una pista de acuerdo a la ubicaci\u00f3n en el juego para evadir secretos. Que est\u00e9n a la par con el estilo de arte del juego funciona muy bien. Buscar en Google Im\u00e1genes \"Sprite Sheets\" es un tip muy \u00fatil para incluir arte del juego. Si eres un buen artista gr\u00e1fico, sera tu tiempo de brillar actualizando badges! Puedes encontrar mas informaci\u00f3n en la Pagina de Creaci\u00f3n de Badges e Iconos . Tips en tu estructura gramatical link No S\u00edmbolos : No utilizas caracteres de acentos/especiales como la \u00e9 en Pokemon, ya que actualmente rompen algunas cosas (como el feed). Cambien no son visibles en la b\u00fasqueda si no se introduce el car\u00e1cter especial. Lo mismo para c\u00f3digos universales de Emoji UTF-8. Excepci\u00f3n Permitida : Scripts de Rich Presence . Cuida tu Ingles : evita errores ortogr\u00e1ficos. Como RetroAchievements es una comunidad internacional, utilizar el Ingles para las Notas de C\u00f3digo es una buena practica, ya que otro desarrollador puede utilizar tus notas en un futuro. Trucos link Encontrando la variable para el Modo Demo link Un truco usual para empezar a filtrar valores para encontrar el Modo Demo es dejar que empieze y asi empezar a filtrar con = \"Last Known Value\" y presionar \"Filter\" suficiente veces, deteni\u00e9ndote una vez que el demo hubiera terminado (ten cuidado de no filtrar despu\u00e9s que se hubiera terminado el demo). Ahora empieza el juego de manera normal y cuando tengas control del personaje cambie el filtro a != y filtra solo una vez . Los valores que se filtraron son los que cambiaron desde el modo demo. Ahora cambien el filtro de regreso a = y entonces inicia una secuencia de jugar-y-filtrar. Que significa juega un poco, mu\u00e9vete por el escenario, derrota algunos enemigos, y entonces filtra. Pro tip : Es muy muy muy \u00fatil tener estados de guardado (savestates) en diferentes niveles del juego, ya que puedes hacer lo de jugar-y-filtrar en diferentes escenarios y hacer el filtrado mas efectivo. Despu\u00e9s de conseguir algunas variables como resultado, por lo general el valor de demo es igual a 1 (algunas veces tambi\u00e9n es ff ). Si encuentras una direcci\u00f3n potencial editala a 0 y checa si eres capaz de mover al personaje. Si s\u00ed, BINGO!, esa es la variable que estabas buscando. Observador de Variables (Address Watcher) link Aqu\u00ed un truco f\u00e1cil utilizando un logro de prueba para observar si una variable tiene cambios, que es algo que tu vas a querer saber com\u00fanmente. Condiciones Explicadas Valor 1 = Valor 0 ; Esto es para prevenir que el logros jamas sea verdadero, ya que el valor 0 nunca va a ser igual a 1. Valor 1 = Valor 1 ; Para que funcione este truco el logro necesita hits para que se resetee. Cuando 1 = 1 hits ser\u00e1n agregados a la condici\u00f3n. ResetIf Mem 0x10 != Delta 0x10 ; Esta es la variable que quieres observar. Cada vez que hay un cambio el logro se va a reiniciar. Por ultimo checa que las casillas de Pause on Reset y Active est\u00e9n marcadas. Ahora vas a conseguir un pop-up y la emulaci\u00f3n se va a pausar cada vez que la variable cambie.

Es mucho mejor utilizar estos valores que utilizar el ID de texto que se muestra en la caja de texto, o, mucho peor, RAM de v\u00eddeo (memoria atada a los gr\u00e1ficos que se muestran en pantalla) ya que muchas veces son menos estables. Especialmente en versiones diferentes del juego, y son mas dif\u00edciles de trabajar. Amamos el Arte : Badges bonitos son badges que dan gusto conseguir! Tiene que representar visualmente el logro en si, o una pista de acuerdo a la ubicaci\u00f3n en el juego para evadir secretos. Que est\u00e9n a la par con el estilo de arte del juego funciona muy bien. Buscar en Google Im\u00e1genes \"Sprite Sheets\" es un tip muy \u00fatil para incluir arte del juego.

Dicas de escava\u00e7\u00e3o de mem\u00f3ria link Voc\u00ea pode inserir valores no Memory Inspector para ver se ele afeta algo no jogo. Se voc\u00ea encontrar um endere\u00e7o, procure tamb\u00e9m a mesma regi\u00e3o que o rodeia e voc\u00ea pode encontrar muitos outros endere\u00e7os \u00fateis.

Se voc\u00ea absolutamente n\u00e3o consegue reduzir os resultados de um filtro, voc\u00ea pode tentar adivinhar alguns valores ou pelo menos como o valor est\u00e1 atuando ( > ou < ). Por exemplo, geralmente nenhuma barra de energia \u00e9 0 , o est\u00e1gio 1 geralmente \u00e9 o valor 0 , o est\u00e1gio 2 geralmente \u00e9 o valor 1 , dependendo do tipo de jogo. Outro exemplo, talvez cada segmento da sua energia tenha 4 barrinhas - Voc\u00ea deve procurar quando \"4\" vai para \"3\" quando voc\u00ea perde uma barrinha? Dicas por n\u00edvel de habilidade link N\u00edvel 1 - F\u00e1cil link Comece com a visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de 8 bits no Memory Inspector. Olhar para grandes partes de mem\u00f3ria ir\u00e1 complicar as coisas, mas isso facilitar\u00e1 o trabalho de um desenvolvedor experiente. Se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 apenas come\u00e7ando e desconhece termos como endianess e bit ordering (ou quando o cansa\u00e7o bate), \u00e9 melhor fazer suas observa\u00e7\u00f5es na vis\u00e3o de 8 bits. \u00c9 mais f\u00e1cil! N\u00edvel 2 - M\u00e9dio link Big data (vista de 16 ou 32 bits): lembre-se de que ao adicionar um endere\u00e7o de 16 bits o endere\u00e7o \u00e0 direita vem primeiro. Exemplo: AB CD WX YZ em 8 bits torna-se CDAB YZWX em 16 bits. Isso \u00e9 chamado de \"ordena\u00e7\u00e3o de bytes big endian\". Voc\u00ea pode tranquilamente ignorar esse papo geek apenas lembrando que as coisas est\u00e3o armazenadas \"de tr\u00e1s pra frente\" na vista de 16 bits e acima. Lembre-se de que se voc\u00ea estiver vendo mem\u00f3ria em peda\u00e7os maiores, quando voc\u00ea destaca um valor, esse valor agora representa um \"peda\u00e7o\" de mem\u00f3ria de 16 ou 32 bits e n\u00e3o o endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria de 8 bits que voc\u00ea pode estar procurando. Voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 voltar para a vis\u00e3o de 8 bits e destacar a endere\u00e7o que te interessa, se voc\u00ea encontrar algo de 8 bits que pare\u00e7a interessante. N\u00edvel 3 - Avan\u00e7ado link Adicionando suporte para os cores libretro Little Endian: N64-specific, na maioria das vezes, ao adicionar suporte para um core libretro LE ao seu set, os conceitos explicados anteriormente (N\u00edvel Intermedi\u00e1rio) se aplicam, com ordena\u00e7\u00e3o de bytes ligeiramente alteradas. O que \u00e9 visto como leg\u00edvel em 16 bits muda drasticamente no interior de um core LE. Exemplo: AB CD WX YZ primeiro pega os bits de A, vira-os como se estivessem olhando em um espelho; bits de B bits e vira-os; bits de C... etc, at\u00e9 Z, e ent\u00e3o se torna WXYZ ABCD com os bytes do seu \u00faltimo passo. Para adicionar o suporte LE, voc\u00ea estar\u00e1 escrevendo uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00facleo falso (Mem 0x000001 = Mem 0x000001), copiando suas condi\u00e7\u00f5es originais n\u00e3o-LE com um 'PauseIf na parte superior em uma Alt, copie as mesmas condi\u00e7\u00f5es para a outra. Ambos os 'PauseIf s conter\u00e3o um cheque olhando para um endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria que nunca muda para ver se o seu valor de 16 bits teve o seu pedido de bytes alterado (Pense nisso como \" PauseIf n\u00e3o estou no n\u00facleo LE\" e \" PauseIf eu sou\" nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es alt). Um funcionar\u00e1 se o jogador estiver executando em um n\u00facleo LE, o outro n\u00e3o. Em seguida, voc\u00ea executar\u00e1 a matem\u00e1tica que descrevi acima nos valores que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 procurando no \" PauseIf , n\u00e3o estou no LE core\" Alt, e atualizando-o. Confuso? Sim. \u00c9 por isso que a maioria dos iniciantes e desenvolvedores intermedi\u00e1rios n\u00e3o deve se preocupar. Dicas de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de achievements link Nunca use / Evite usar apenas uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o, tanto quanto voc\u00ea puder . Ao usar apenas uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o, o achievement provavelmente ir\u00e1 aparecer na hora errada. Este \u00e9 o erro mais comum cometido por um desenvolvedor , resultando na justificativa \"Popped at the Wrong Time\" anexada nos Bug Tickets recebidos em RetroAchievements.org. Programe suas conquistas com robustez. PauseIf Demo Mode : Se o jogo tiver um modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o (AI joga o jogo depois de esperar um pouco na tela de t\u00edtulo), assegure-se de encontrar o endere\u00e7o para isso e adicione mode != Demo ou algo semelhante em suas conquistas. Reiniciar Acontece : Alguns emuladores enviam um valor espec\u00edfico para a RAM quando reiniciados / recarregados. \u00c9 apenas para o primeiro quadro, mas pode fazer com que os achievements disparem, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea precisa se preparar para isso. Geralmente, \u00e9 um valor como o FF. Voc\u00ea pode ver o valor se voc\u00ea usar Frame Advance / Next Frame ao reiniciar o jogo. Limita\u00e7\u00f5es : H\u00e1 um limite de 100 achievements, um teto de 400 pontos e um limite de caracteres para uma \u00fanica conquista (tente n\u00e3o colocar mais de 50 condi\u00e7\u00f5es em uma conquista, isso \u00e9 mais amor do que o RetroAchievements consegue lidar!). Alt groups (lado esquerdo do editor) s\u00e3o usados para \"ou\" condi\u00e7\u00f5es. O grupo Core est\u00e1 sempre l\u00e1 e deve sempre ser verdadeiro com pelo menos um grupo Alt sendo completamente verdadeiro para obter um achievement. O grupo inteiro \u00e9 a sua condi\u00e7\u00e3o \"ou\". Mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a p\u00e1gina Achievement Logic Features page . Evite o spam de achievement . Se um jogo tiver 100 n\u00edveis, n\u00e3o fa\u00e7a um achievement para cada n\u00edvel. Fa\u00e7a a cada 25 ou mais. Geralmente, \u00e9 avaliado pela equipe de desenvolvimento da RA para codificar esses achievements do tipo \"Filler\". Se voc\u00ea pretende criar alguns desbloqueios progressivos desta maneira - as palavras: (\"F\u00e1cil\", \"M\u00e9dio\", \"Dif\u00edcil\") ajudar\u00e3o a coloc\u00e1-lo em contexto. Considere o segmento de tempo que um jogador casual desbloquearia esses achievements progressivos. Se, em geral, voc\u00ea poderia desbloquear tudo em um conjunto progressivo de achievements desta natureza em menos de meia hora como jogador casual, design de preenchimento e n\u00e3o recomendado. Seja criativo e divertido : Seja t\u00e3o criativo quanto poss\u00edvel com achievements. \"Beat X sem usar / fazer Y\", \"Beat X em 5 segundos\", \"3 heart run\". Certifique-se de que os jogadores ocasionais ainda podem obter estes com seu melhor esfor\u00e7o. N\u00e3o \u00e9 divertido se for muito dif\u00edcil para um jogador casual! (Veja: Dicas de b\u00f4nus abaixo para os desafios reais!). H\u00e1 uma p\u00e1gina inteira sobre Achievement Design que pode dar bons conselhos sobre como pensar sobre bons achievements. Glitchless, please! : N\u00e3o fa\u00e7a achievements que exijam falhas. As falhas, na maioria dos casos, corrompem e desestabilizam a mem\u00f3ria do jogo e a RAM. Eles quebram o resto do conjunto para incluir. No entanto, \u00e9 aconselh\u00e1vel codificar as paredes do bloco impedindo os jogadores de us\u00e1-los para obter um dom\u00ednio f\u00e1cil. Este \u00e9 um tema de muito debate no RA, uma vez que o achievement d\u00e1 uma falha de quebra do jogo \u00e0s vezes requer muita habilidade de jogador. Algumas falhas s\u00e3o poss\u00edveis apenas no console, algumas apenas em emulador. Por sua inconsist\u00eancia e instabilidade em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 mem\u00f3ria, \u00e9 recomend\u00e1vel bloque\u00e1-los para proteger a integridade do seu conjunto e sua reputa\u00e7\u00e3o. (Este \u00e9 um problema excepcional em alguns jogos do GameBoy, onde o playground falou em seu caminho para a vit\u00f3ria foi prominente!) N\u00f3s amamos arte : Emblemas bonitos s\u00e3o emblemas gratificantes! Ele deve representar visualmente a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o em si, ou sugerir o local no jogo para os segredos. Corresponder ao estilo de arte do jogo funciona bem. O Google Image busca \"Sprite Sheets\" \u00e9 uma dica \u00fatil para incluir alguma arte do jogo. Se voc\u00ea \u00e9 um bom artista gr\u00e1fico, atualizar emblemas \u00e9 o seu tempo para brilhar! Mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es podem ser encontradas na Badge and Icon Creation page . Desmarque \"Show Decimal Values\" no Achievement Editor para que voc\u00ea possa inserir os valores hexadecimais que voc\u00ea v\u00ea no Visualizador de mem\u00f3ria. \u00c9 melhor do que usar a calculadora de um programador! 16-bit segredos : Os requisitos de 16 bits n\u00e3o precisam ser usados em um n\u00famero par de RAM, eles podem ser usados adequadamente, mesmo que a visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de 16 bits n\u00e3o o mostre corretamente. Ex: 0 1 2 3 4 5, em 16 bits geralmente \u00e9 visto como 10 32 54, mas se voc\u00ea come\u00e7ar o endere\u00e7o no 1 aqui em sua exig\u00eancia, \"21\" ser\u00e1 lido pela conquista, mesmo que seja de 16 bits A visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o no visor de mem\u00f3ria n\u00e3o est\u00e1 mostrando isso. Tamb\u00e9m funciona se \u00e9 o \u00faltimo endere\u00e7o na linha (come\u00e7ando em F, indo para 0). Esteja ciente de que, se voc\u00ea estiver codificando por n\u00facleos LE, voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m precisar\u00e1 atualizar isso! Sempre deixe notas de c\u00f3digo descritivo para si ou para outra pessoa. Bit field segredos : Use bits simples (0-7) para coisas que apenas alteram um \u00fanico bit. No Memory Viewer, quando um endere\u00e7o \u00e9 selecionado, haver\u00e1 \"bits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\" acima dos endere\u00e7os, e abaixo desses n\u00fameros ser\u00e3o \"0\" ou \"1\" como \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \"se bit3 tiver um 1 abaixo dele, bit3 = 1 para esse endere\u00e7o. O uso de um \u00fanico bit \u00e9 muito comum para eventos / desbloqueios de jogos / etc. Voc\u00ea vai querer usar estes em jogos onde voc\u00ea pode fazer coisas em diferentes ordens, di\u00e1logos, eventos, desbloqueios .. Se voc\u00ea verificar \"8 bits x = 7 \"e algu\u00e9m fez algo diferente, como saltar algo ou obter algo extra, seu valor de 8 bits provavelmente ser\u00e1 diferente porque os \u00fanicos bits dentro s\u00e3o diferentes e a conquista n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 desbloqueada, ent\u00e3o neste caso voc\u00ea verifique se h\u00e1 bits espec\u00edficos dentro o endere\u00e7o de 8 bits. Agora, se, por exemplo, os desbloqueios de itens usam todos os 8 bits do endere\u00e7o de 8 bits e voc\u00ea quer fazer \"desbloquear todos os itens\", voc\u00ea pode apenas fazer \"8 bits x = 0xff\" Isso pode ser confuso, mas \u00e9 muito importante para entender. Alguns jogos com espa\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria limitado usam muito os campos de bits! \u00c9 uma t\u00e9cnica importante para aprender.

PauseIf cheat codes : If the game has a cheat code to increase lives, select stages, etc. Make sure to find the addresses for it and add some kind of protection in your achievements. If you wanna create an achievement for collecting a specific and unique item in the game, add some conditions to make sure the player got the item where it is supposed to be obtained, like in this template here .

It is however, wise to code block walls stopping players from using them to get easy mastery. Avoid relying on text and graphics : Most of the time, an achievement that requires triggering a special event can be tied to an event flag (usually a single bit or byte), or to an item received by the player. It is better practice to use these values than to check the ID of text being displayed in a text box, or, even worse, video RAM (memory tied to the actual graphics displaying on the screen) as they are often less stable.

As RetroAchievements is an international community, using English for Code Notes is a good practice, as another developer can use your notes in the future. Tricks link Finding the address for Demo Mode link An usual trick to start filtering addresses to find the Demo Mode is to let the demo begin and then start to filter = \"Last Known Value\" and press \"Filter\" many times, stopping right before the demo ends (be careful to not filter after the demo ends). Now start the game normally and when you're able to control the character change the filter to != and then filter one single time . The filtered addresses are the ones that has changed since the demo mode. Now change the filtering back to = and then start a sequence of play-and-filter. Which means play a bit, move around then scenario, defeat some enemies, and then filter. Pro tip : It is very very very useful to have savestates in different levels of the game, so you can do the play-and-filter in different scenarios and make the filtering more effective. After getting a few addresses as result, quite often the demo value will be 1 (sometimes it's also ff ). If you find a potential address edit it to 0 and check if you become able to control the character. If yes, BINGO!, that's the address you're looking for. Address Watcher link Here's an easy trick using a dummy achievement to watch an address for any changes, which is something you'll quite often want to know. Conditions Explained Value 1 = Value 0 ; This is to prevent the achievement from ever being true, as the value 0 never equals 1. Value 1 = Value 1 ; For this trick to work the achievement needs hits to reset. When 1 = 1 hits will be added to this condition. ResetIf Mem 0x10 != Delta 0x10 ; This is the address you want to watch. Any time there is a change the achievement will reset. Last of all make sure that Pause on Reset and Active are both checked. Now you will get a pop-up and emulation will pause each time this address changes.

This allows the runtime to know when an achievement is about to trigger, so a challenge indicator can be shown on the screen. When all conditions that must be true for the achievement to trigger are true except those marked with the Trigger flag, the achievement will become Primed. It will remain Primed as long as all of the previous conditions remain true, or until the achievement triggers or is deactivated. This functionality allows putting indicators on the screen to help players know when a challenge is active, or more importantly, when they fail the challenge. A prime example would be for a damageless boss fight. The Trigger flag would be put on the \"boss is dead\" condition. When all other conditions are true (in boss fight, boss at full hp ( HitCount 1), not demo), the challenge indicator would be displayed. If the player takes damage, the HitCount on the \"boss at full hp\" condition would get reset, and the challenge indicator would go away. Interaction with PauseIf link If the achievement is Paused while Primed, the indicator will remain on screen even if the other non-Trigger conditions become false. If it is Paused before it is Primed, the indicator will not be shown until the achievement in unpaused. When the achievement becomes unpaused, the indicator may be displayed or hidden depending on the state of the non-Trigger conditions.

First, we'll look at an achievement from Suikoden (PlayStation) entitled Treasure Hunter - Dragon Knights' Domain : Addresses Used 0x1b8244 : bit0-bit4 are treasures in Soniere, bit5 is a treasure at the Northern Checkpoint, and bit6-bit7 are treasures at the Dragon Den. 0x1b8245 : bit0 is a treasure at the Dragon Den, bit1-bit5 are treasures at Seek Valley, and bit6-7 are treasures in Kalekka. 0x1b824b : bit0-bit1 are treasures at the Village of the Hidden Rune, bit2 is unused, bit3-4 are treasures at the Dragon Knights' Fortress, bit5-6 are treasures in Teien, and bit7 is a treasure at Luiken's House. This particular achievement only requires treasures from Dragon Knights' Fortress, Dragon Den, and Seek Valley; therefore, we only need bit6-7 from 0x1b8244 , bit0-bit5 from 0x1b8245 , and bit3-bit4 from 0x1b824b . Logic Breakdown There are two groups of ten conditions with the main differences being the Delta type and the total. This is to ensure that the player goes from nine of these treasures obtained to having all ten of these treasures obtained. Note: Remember to use hexadecimal for Add Source totals! Since we're using bitflags here, the totals for individual conditions will only ever be 0x00 or 0x01. Obviously, we want them all to be 0x01 for the trigger, but we don't want someone to get the achievement simply by loading a save with all ten treasures already found. The trigger is the first frame that the player goes from nine to ten treasures obtained. This is to help prevent the achievement from triggering when it's not supposed to. The Measured flag is on the last condition so the player can check how far they are from their goal. If they have eight out of ten treasures, the achievement will show that it is 80% complete in the overlay (RAEmus) or achievement menu (RetroArch). This method is mostly handy for when the totals between the Delta-type and Mem-type only have a difference of 0x01, but it can be used in various types of achievements: collectibles that are only obtainable one-at-a-time, map completion (such as dungeon-crawlers with viewable maps that get revealed as you enter new areas), learnable skills, completing a certain number of side missions, and many others.

Hardcore/Softcore link Some users like to use the save/load state feature to save their progress in a game. As you may know, this feature isn't allowed when playing with hardcore mode. But some users aren't hardcore gamers and prefer to keep hardcore mode disabled (let's call this mode as softcore). From time to time some users report that an achievement isn't triggering, and when asked they say they were playing in softcore. One thing you all have to keep in mind is: If you use the load state feature expect to have issues of cheevos not triggering when they are expected to trigger. Here we'll try to explain for those who don't know the details of achievements development why this kind of issue happen. Basic concept behind an achievement link Technically an achievement is a group of conditions that must be met in a particular frame of the video game. When you launch a game on an emulator with the RetroAchievements feature, the emulator is always checking if those conditions are met in the current frame. When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement. Examples of conditions: lifebar is full lifebar decreased have 9 lives currently on stage 3 at the title screen of the game starting the boss fight the game is paused The problem with the softcore is that when you load a saved state you can ruin the logic behind an achievement. Examples link Example 1: Beat the game without passwords link Imagine a game with 5 stages and with the password feature. Probably the conditions to trigger the \"Beat the game without passwords\" are (in a real cheevo there will be more conditions, but for this explanation let's consider only these ones): be at stage 1 (and memorize this event as something that happened) be at stage 2 (memorize it) be at stage 3 (memorize it) be at stage 4 (memorize it) be at stage 5 (memorize it) finish stage 5 So to get this achievement you have to pass through all stages and then beat the game. When you are at the stage 1, the emulator memorizes it, same thing for all other stages. And when you finish the stage 5 (beat the game) you get the achievement. Now imagine this scenario: a softcore player started the game and played stages 1, 2 and 3 he needed to stop playing when at stage 4 and then he saved a state to continue later he closed the emulator later he could play again, started the game and loaded the state he saved played stages 4, 5 and beated the game In this scenario the achievement won't trigger. After closing the emulator it \"forgets\" that you passed through stages 1, 2 and 3. When you run the emulator/game again and load the state being on stage 4, the emulator won't detect that you passed through the previous stages. Then the achievement won't trigger. Example 2: Defeat boss X without taking damage link Most likely the conditions to be met in a frame to make this achievement trigger are: entered the boss room (and memorize this event as something that happened). if take any damage, forget it entered the boss room. beat the boss. In other words: to get this achievement the emulator must \"know\" that you entered the boss room, didn't get any damage, and beated the boss. The important detail to pay attention here: when you get any damage, the emulator \"forgets\" that you entered the boss room. Then even if you load a state to a point where you didn't get any damage but already entered the room, the emulator won't detect that you entered the room. And then the achievement won't trigger. Final Words link When reporting a broken achievement give as many details as possible, and don't forget to mention if you are playing on hardcore mode or not . If you want to request an admin to manually award to you an achievement that didn't triggered, be sure to provide a qualified proof. Specially for achievements like those in the examples above (no damage, no passwords, no death, etc).

Now imagine this scenario: a softcore player started the game and played stages 1, 2 and 3 he needed to stop playing when at stage 4 and then he saved a state to continue later he closed the emulator later he could play again, started the game and loaded the state he saved played stages 4, 5 and beated the game In this scenario the achievement won't trigger. After closing the emulator it \"forgets\" that you passed through stages 1, 2 and 3. When you run the emulator/game again and load the state being on stage 4, the emulator won't detect that you passed through the previous stages. Then the achievement won't trigger.","title":"Example 1: Beat the game without passwords"},{"location":"Why-you-shouldn%27t-use-the-load-state-feature/#example-2-defeat-boss-x-without-taking-damage","text":"Most likely the conditions to be met in a frame to make this achievement trigger are: entered the boss room (and memorize this event as something that happened). if take any damage, forget it entered the boss room. beat the boss.

The important detail to pay attention here: when you get any damage, the emulator \"forgets\" that you entered the boss room.

This is true in cases of existing official revisions (ex. Rev 1), official and unofficial fix patches, and alternate regions. Bonus Sets and Multi sets are an exception to this rule, but are considered an extension to a standard set and follow different rules for what types of achievements are allowed. Regional exceptions may exist -rarely- when regional variations massively change the game. ROM Selection link Almost every game has multiple ROM versions available, sometimes dozens. Often there are major differences under the hood that prevent achievement compatibility between version. Because of this, finding the best ROM for achievements is critical and should be done carefully. Region Selection : For TV-connected consoles, when possible choose No-Intro (cartridge) or Redump (disc) NTSC USA release ROMs, because 60Hz is a smoother gaming experience and generally matches the intended play speed. PAL European releases run at 50Hz, and are to be avoided in most cases. NTSC Japan releases also run at 60Hz, but are only the best choice if the game was a Japan-exclusive release. PAL European releases should be used as a last resort only (Europe-only exclusive), and are typically limited to a very select few unique games from the entire console's library. Handheld consoles don't have regional timing differences, so language options should be prioritized there whenever possible. Revision Selection : Since revisions primarily contain bug and typo fixes, unless you have a -specific- reason not to, always choose the final revision. This will often save both players and developers headaches in the long run. Before working on a game, do a quick search for known revisional changes and take a look at TCRF to see if there's a reason to prefer an earlier revision. Ring Codes : Some systems, such as Sega Saturn, have multiple version of the game with different \"ring codes\". These are alphanumeric identifiers stamped on the inner ring of the physical discs. In most cases these will have no functional effect on the game or perhaps even the hash, but as mentioned with Revisions, check to see if there are known differences first. Format : For most systems this won't be an issue if you've used verified good dumps. For N64 in particular, games can exist in three formats based on the order of the bytes in the file: n64 (little endian), v64 (byteswapped), and z64 (big endian). Despite producing unique hashes, these three formats are identical for the same dump. Because big endian is the most accurate representation of the N64's cartridges, the big endian (z64) hash -must- be linked for any N64 game, in addition to whatever format you may wish to use personally as a developer. This ensures a single set of roms can consistently be used to play. If required, Tool64 can be used to change byte order. Arcade : Arcade ROMs are a bit of a special case because FBNeo mandates the exact contents of the game's archive. When different versions exist, the base version of the name should be preferred in general (for instance, mslug2 should be preferred over mslug2dg or mslug2t). This is merely a guideline, as there may be various reasons to prefer a different version. No Mods : Use a clean ROM. Do not use a ROM with a modded/custom launch screen such as Mode7 and RisingSun have because it changes RAM values and complicates users' ability to use their own legally dumped ROMs. No Trainers : Do not use a ROM that includes an integrated cheat feature. These are most often refereed to as after-market ROM trainers , are not official, and are not in any way supported by RetroAchievements. These ROMs cannot be linked even as secondary options. Preservation Groups link No-Intro and Redump are the primary groups responsible for verifying clean dumps of console games, excluding all modifications and untrustworthy sources in the process. They offer dat files that can be used to verify your own dumps via a ROM manager. ROMs verified by these groups are preferred whenever possible, and can generally be identified by the following naming scheme: Game Name (Region) (Available Languages if Applicable) (Current Revision if Applicable) Example: Diddy Kong Racing (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev 1) TOSEC is another less restrictive preservation group. Their hashes often will match Redump for discs, but will frequently contain less thoroughly verified dumps. For floppy discs, cassettes, and less well-known systems where No-Intro and/or Redump verification aren't avaliable, TOSEC is a good fallback choice. You can verify that your ROM checksum matches the databases of No-Intro, Redump, or TOSEC either by using a rom manager with a dat provided by the preferred group or by verifying checksum manually and searching the dat for it in a text editor. Bear in mind that unlike a manual check, the rom manager may be able to skip over external headers to accurately verify integrity. Standard choices are clrmamepro and Romulus . Translation patches link (see also: ROM Localization Policy below) English is the Primary language of RetroAchievements. Translation Patches are sometimes applied by developers to non-English titles as the main hash for an achievement set where no licenced English version exists. In these cases patching instructions will be provided in the forum thread of that title. Whenever reasonable, the original unpatched version should still be supported as well. Sometimes translation patches may produce critically different memory from the linked hashes. All linked hashes are expected to be fully supported by the -entire- achievement set. If you can't personally guarantee this, don't link the hash. If you aren't the original developer of the set in question and the developer is active, verify memory personally using testing mode and contact the developer before attempting to add a new translation. ROM Localization Policy link As English is the primary language of the community, English ROMs are preferred. When choosing which ROM to build achievements for, we give priority to No-Intro or Redump US ROMs for non-handheld consoles and European ROMs for handheld consoles . We would like to continue improving our support for all regional versions, especially Japanese (as the majority of our game library was created in Japan). Some users may also prefer a specific regional version of a game and it is better to include broad support so that any good ROM can link to a good entry and give appropriate achievements. That said, regional variants must still be fully supported, and 50Hz slowdown needs to be mitigated (via additional patches) or proven to be a non-issue when present. When looking at how games with regional versions are handled, our standard is one entry per game per console . It is ideal that if a player loads up the US or Japanese version of Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, or Contra, they will earn the same achievements from the same entry. As mentioned above, there are some extremely rare situations where it is better for our library and players to split off regional versions into their own unique entry. If the community has reason to believe that it's better for an entry to be split, it can be reviewed and approved by the RetroAchievements staff. Tip: For games with text-triggered achievements (especially RPGs) it's recommend to find an event flag instead of hooking onto text or text ID. Text presentation varies between regional versions, making multi-region support difficult. Localization Differences link The types of changes made during localization (most commonly from Japanese to English) can vary wildly. Any of the following changes may result from a localization: Little or no change at all; Passwords replace battery saves; Bugs fixed; Light or extensive translations; Light or extensive cosmetic changes including \"offensive\" elements being censored, sfx changes, licenced assets being replaced with generic ones, and/or unknown characters becoming Nintendoed (e.g. Tetris Attack, Super Mario Bros. 2); Stages added, modified or removed; Game physics and game mechanics modified; Game modes, difficulty levels and game options added or removed; Cheat codes or debug modes added or removed; Game rebalancing resulting in a harder or easier experience, sometimes significantly so; Two games combined into one; And more. Because of this variation and to avoid filling the database with unnecessary duplicates, our goal is to minimize the number of split sets. For a set to be split it needs compelling reasons; we take great care to determine when to approve these splits.

Often there are major differences under the hood that prevent achievement compatibility between version. Because of this, finding the best ROM for achievements is critical and should be done carefully. Region Selection : For TV-connected consoles, when possible choose No-Intro (cartridge) or Redump (disc) NTSC USA release ROMs, because 60Hz is a smoother gaming experience and generally matches the intended play speed. PAL European releases run at 50Hz, and are to be avoided in most cases. NTSC Japan releases also run at 60Hz, but are only the best choice if the game was a Japan-exclusive release. PAL European releases should be used as a last resort only (Europe-only exclusive), and are typically limited to a very select few unique games from the entire console's library. Handheld consoles don't have regional timing differences, so language options should be prioritized there whenever possible. Revision Selection : Since revisions primarily contain bug and typo fixes, unless you have a -specific- reason not to, always choose the final revision. This will often save both players and developers headaches in the long run. Before working on a game, do a quick search for known revisional changes and take a look at TCRF to see if there's a reason to prefer an earlier revision. Ring Codes : Some systems, such as Sega Saturn, have multiple version of the game with different \"ring codes\". These are alphanumeric identifiers stamped on the inner ring of the physical discs. In most cases these will have no functional effect on the game or perhaps even the hash, but as mentioned with Revisions, check to see if there are known differences first. Format : For most systems this won't be an issue if you've used verified good dumps. For N64 in particular, games can exist in three formats based on the order of the bytes in the file: n64 (little endian), v64 (byteswapped), and z64 (big endian). Despite producing unique hashes, these three formats are identical for the same dump. Because big endian is the most accurate representation of the N64's cartridges, the big endian (z64) hash -must- be linked for any N64 game, in addition to whatever format you may wish to use personally as a developer. This ensures a single set of roms can consistently be used to play. If required, Tool64 can be used to change byte order. Arcade : Arcade ROMs are a bit of a special case because FBNeo mandates the exact contents of the game's archive. When different versions exist, the base version of the name should be preferred in general (for instance, mslug2 should be preferred over mslug2dg or mslug2t). This is merely a guideline, as there may be various reasons to prefer a different version. No Mods : Use a clean ROM. Do not use a ROM with a modded/custom launch screen such as Mode7 and RisingSun have because it changes RAM values and complicates users' ability to use their own legally dumped ROMs. No Trainers : Do not use a ROM that includes an integrated cheat feature. These are most often refereed to as after-market ROM trainers , are not official, and are not in any way supported by RetroAchievements. These ROMs cannot be linked even as secondary options.","title":"ROM Selection"},{"location":"Working-with-the-Right-ROM/#preservation-groups","text":"No-Intro and Redump are the primary groups responsible for verifying clean dumps of console games, excluding all modifications and untrustworthy sources in the process. They offer dat files that can be used to verify your own dumps via a ROM manager. ROMs verified by these groups are preferred whenever possible, and can generally be identified by the following naming scheme: Game Name (Region) (Available Languages if Applicable) (Current Revision if Applicable) Example: Diddy Kong Racing (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev 1) TOSEC is another less restrictive preservation group. Their hashes often will match Redump for discs, but will frequently contain less thoroughly verified dumps. For floppy discs, cassettes, and less well-known systems where No-Intro and/or Redump verification aren't avaliable, TOSEC is a good fallback choice. You can verify that your ROM checksum matches the databases of No-Intro, Redump, or TOSEC either by using a rom manager with a dat provided by the preferred group or by verifying checksum manually and searching the dat for it in a text editor. Bear in mind that unlike a manual check, the rom manager may be able to skip over external headers to accurately verify integrity. Standard choices are clrmamepro and Romulus .","title":"Preservation Groups"},{"location":"Working-with-the-Right-ROM/#translation-patches","text":"(see also: ROM Localization Policy below) English is the Primary language of RetroAchievements.
