Not following this will result in moderation.\n\n\nFor the sanity and morale of the community try to keep your criticism encouraging, constructive and optimistic.\n\n\nDiscord Chat Specific Rules\nlink\n\n\nStay on topic within the channel you are in. Some channels are strict in this while others are very flexible. Check the channel description at the top and also see how others are using the channel.\n\n\nForum Etiquette\nlink\n\n\nPost it!\nlink\n\n\n\n\nYour post is on-topic, it directly relates to the subject of the thread.\n\n\nYour post brings new ideas or outlooks to the discussion. \n\n\nYour post has your ideas and point of view on the subject. \n\n\nYour post is a direct answer to the question of others. \n\n\nYour post is reiterating long buried points that you believe need new light. \n\n\nYour post has reasoned criticism of other's view points and ideas. \n\n\nYour post has evidence to back up your claims.\n\n\n\n\nLeave it out!\nlink\n\n\n\n\nTrolling, or making fun of the position or character of others. \n\n\nVague complaints.\n\n\nmemes, teasing.\n\n\nOff topic chatting or meta-discussion.\n\n\nAgreeing or validating other users, \nwithout adding reasoning\n. \n\n\nDisagreeing or criticizing the position of others with others without providing a reasoned counter-argument. \n\n\nSpam and content-less posts. \n\n\nDirectly or indirectly attacking the character of other posters. \n\n\nAggressively or passive-aggressively attacking the position of others. \n\n\nArguing with or opposing moderator directions. \n\n\n\n\nIf others are showing bad form \ndo not play the moderator!\n\n- Instead of matching or one-uping their tone be the bigger person and use good forum etiquette. \n- Instead of telling them they are spamming/trolling/flaming/being toxic ignore that portion or all of what they've said and contact a moderator (if needed). Responding or playing moderator adds fuel to the fire and feeds trolls. \n\n\nIf you feel moderation is needed direct your issues to \nRAdmin\n, a shared mod-mail account, via PM.\n\n\nIf you have problems with how any moderation action takes place send a PM to \nRAdmin\n or email \nramodmail@gmail.com\n. This is a shared moderation account that all mods and admin see, the issue will be discussed and dealt with fairly.\n\n\nArguments\nlink\n\n\nIt's fine and often good to have an argument, but it's important to keep it productive. See \nGraham's Hierarchy of Disagreement\n to know what is appropriate. Anything below \ncontradiction\n is not good enough for the forum, as in criticizing tone, attacking the character of others or name-calling isn't acceptable.\n\n\nCheating\nlink\n\n\nCheck the \nGlobal Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules\n.\n\n\nAccounts that are proven to be cheating will be set to \"\nUntracked\n\" and in some cases they can be banned.\n\n\nIf you suspect others of cheating, do not make a public accusation. Share your evidence with the mods/admin and wait for careful review. Cheat accusations can be extremely disruptive to the community and are often unfounded or do not have certain enough evidence to warrant punishment. Your accusation will remain anonymous and the admin/staff will publicly post a response to the evidence.\n\n\n\n\nExample: \n_ user was accused of cheating, after reviewing evidence, \n__, \n_, \n_. We found that there is sufficient/insufficient evidence for them to be untracked.\n\n\n\n\nReporting\nlink\n\n\nInstances of unacceptable behavior or cheating may be reported by contacting the RetroAchievements mods team at \nDiscord Server\n (users with blue names). You can also contact all active admin/mods by sending a Private Message to the \nRAdmin user in the official website\n.\n\n\nComplaints will be reviewed, investigated and responded to as fitting to the circumstances.\n\n\nAdmin/Mods Responsibilities\nlink\n\n\nAdmin/Mods are responsible for keeping this community functioning well. They must uphold this Code of Conduct and the \nAchievement Developer's one\n on the website and on the Discord server. Their duties on these two fronts are detailed below.\n\n\nOn the website\nlink\n\n\n\n\nWithin the rules of the Code of Conduct, remove or reject\n\n\ncomments,\n\n\nachievements,\n\n\nbadges,\n\n\nforum posts,\n\n\nany other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Untrack\" users found to be cheating.\n\n\nWarn, ban temporarily or permanently members who are violating this Code of Conduct excessively, a warning being given first in most cases.\n\n\nWhen the inappropriate behavior is not very clear, the staff will discuss among themselves what action should be taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Discord\nlink\n\n\n\n\nProvide help when it's asked for, preferably showing a doc page with the answer (so people can start to use RADocs to find the answers they need).\n\n\nKeep channels on topic, but with a degree of looseness in the general channels, as to allow for the natural flow of conversation.\n\n\nVerify users on Discord.\n\n\nEnsure user's nickname on Discord match the website's one. Accepted exception: \nDiscordNick (RA_Username)\n.\n\n\nManage roles, like:\n\n\nGive \njr-dev\n role to those who show interest on create achievements (and at least have read some basic docs)\n\n\nGive \ndeveloper\n for those who have Developer status on the website.\n\n\nManage \nAotW Winner\n role.\n\n\nManage the \n*-news\n roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases of those who are violating this Code of Conduct excessively, admin/mods will use their judgement to kick those users from the server, a warning being given first in most cases. If they come back and keep the bad behavior, most likely they'll be banned.\n\n\nWhen the inappropriate behavior is not very clear, the staff will discuss among themselves what action should be taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin/mods who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-07-11 13:11] Kvon:\n User CoC: some forum etiquette cleanup\n\n\n[2019-07-07 16:09] Kvon:\n Code of Conduct: typo\n\n\n[2019-07-07 15:56] Kvon:\n User code of conduct: Added forum specific rules, and also a discord specific rule\n\n\n[2019-07-07 15:08] Kvon:\n Users CoC: Clarified how staff will respond to cheat accusations.\n\n\n[2019-07-04 20:01] Kvon:\n User Code of Conduct: Updated the working on cheat accusations\n\n\n[2019-06-23 15:15] Kvon:\n added \"keep on topic\"\n\n\n[2019-06-09 21:41] Kvon:\n unwelcome behavior: public accusations of cheating\n\n\n[2019-01-04 08:55] meleu:\n added link to \"Global Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules\" on the \"Cheating\" topic\n\n\n[2018-10-11 00:15] CoolCanuck:\n https\n\n\n[2018-09-20 22:29] meleu:\n no colons on headings",

(If I don't remember my password)\n\n\nWill I have any privilege if I become a patron?\n\n\nIs RetroAchievements profiting off of emulation?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is RetroAchievements.org?\nlink\n\n\nRetroAchievements.org\n is a \nzero profit\n community who collaborate and compete to earn custom-made achievements in classic games through emulation. Achievements are made by and for the community. We provide various custom-built emulators for you to use which will detect when you have completed various challenges. Once logged in, the emulators will post the achievements you've completed back to the site, so you can check and compare your progress to your friends.\n\n\nHere's an example of RAGens, playing Streets of Rage 2. You will see two leaderboard attempt counters (bottom-right), one achievement popping and finally the \nAchievement Overlay\n (press \nESC\n):\n\n\n\n\nWhat is HARDCORE mode?\nlink\n\n\nHARDCORE mode is an additional feature to separate out the good gamers from the great gamers: HARDCORE mode disables \nall\n savestate ability in the emulator: you would not be able to save and reload at any time. You would have to complete the game and get the achievements first time, just like it were on the original console. In reward for this, you will earn both the standard and the HARDCORE achievement, in effect earning double points! A regular game worth 400 points, is now worth 800 if you complete it fully on HARDCORE! For example: if you complete the game fully for 400 points, you then have the opportunity to earn another 400 on HARDCORE.\n\n\nNote\n: If you want to play with the HARDCORE mode disabled (also known as \"softcore\"), expect to have some issues. Read in \nthis link Why you shouldn't use the load state feature\n.\n\n\nWhich emulator do I need to use?\nlink\n\n\nThe official \nRetroAchievements.org\n emulators are all Windows-based. For other operating systems you can use RetroArch. More information below:\n\n\nOfficial RetroAchievements.org emulators\nlink\n\n\nPlease download the emulator of your choice from \nthe download page\n, log in using your username and password (yeah, you need to create an account first), then load a ROM and play!\n\n\nWhat is the Achievement Overlay and how do I access it?\nlink\n\n\nThe Achievement Overlay is a built-in RetroAchievements screen that shows the achievements you can earn and their descriptions of what is required, which achievements you have earned, your achievement score, details on high score leaderboard scores, and more.\n\n\nNormally, to access it, this will be set up on \nESC\n keyboard key, or the pause function in the game. In most emulators, a game must be active for it to be functional.\n\n\nSome of the emulators should already be setup assigning a controller button to view the achievement overlay. Generally \nESC\n on the keyboard should activate it, but if you want to assign it to a controller, here are some tricks for some of the official emulators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor RAVBA, go to Tools \u21d2 Customize and set FilePause to a button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor RASNES, go to Input \u21d2 Customize Hotkeys and change Pause/Overlay on page 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor RANES, Config \u21d2 Map Hotkeys and change Pause to a button (\nNote\n: this can crash the emulator, do it without a rom loaded for better chances).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetroArch emulators\nlink\n\n\nFor non-Windows operating systems you need to use \nRetroArch\n.\n\n\nCurrently you can earn achievements via RetroArch on the following platforms:\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nMac\n\n\nAndroid (yes! you can earn achievements on-the-go with your Android phone!)\n\n\nPlayStation Vita (needs to be hacked with \nHENkaku\n)\n\n\nPlayStation 3\n\n\nWii U\n\n\nRaspberry Pi (recommended systems: \nRetroPie\n, \nlakka\n and \nRecalBox\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou can get RetroArch on the following links:\n\n\n\n\nstable\n\n\nnightly\n\n\n\n\nOnce you installed and did the initial configuration, follow this guide to setup Achievements: \nhttps://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/\n\n\nWhich RetroArch core should I use?\nlink\n\n\nKeep in mind that not every RetroArch core is compatible with RetroAchievements. \nCheck this list to see which one to choose\n.\n\n\nHow can I see the badge when I earn an achievement on RetroArch?\nlink\n\n\nThis feature was implemented in RetroArch 1.7.7 (May/2019), however there are some platforms where it still doesn't work (such as PS Vita). You just need to assure the Menu Widget option enabled (and it's usually enabled by default).\n\n\nWhat are the white points?\nlink\n\n\nWhite points, known as Retro Ratio points, are secondary points based on how hard an achievement is, \nhowever this feature is not very accurate currently\n. Explained \nhere in detail\n.\n\n\nMy welcome email has gone missing!\nlink\n\n\nUnfortunately sometimes the welcome email has been known to go missing. If this happens, please log in with your username/password you registered with, then visit your settings page. At the top you'll find the option to resend your registration email.\n\n\nWhy can't I see my new profile picture?\nlink\n\n\nPress \nCtrl + F5\n (on most browsers). Sometimes after you've changed your profile picture (also known as avatar or user pic) and you need to refresh your browser cache; in most browsers \nCtrl + F5\n is the quickest way to do it.\n\n\nWhere can I find ROMs?\nlink\n\n\nNot here. It is illegal to host or distribute copyrighted ROMs. However we have a page about \nFree Games\n where you can find some really cool homebrews.\n\n\nWhy is my game not loading up achievements?\nlink\n\n\nEither:\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn't have achievements.\n\n\nYou have the incorrect rom.\n\n\n\n\nA good practice is to check the official game's forum topic. If you still don't have an answer check this page here for more details: \nMy game is not loading achievements\n.\n\n\nRetroArch/RALibretro doesn't launch my arcade game. What should I do?\nlink\n\n\nFirst things first\n: be sure you're using the correct RetroArch core. Check here which core you should use to get the RetroAchievements feature for arcade games: \nhttps://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/#arcade\n\n\nSecond thing\n: Arcade ROMs are more complicated than console ROMs. There are a few concepts and terminology you need to understand and then it will start to make sense. Here is a good text on this matter: \nDemystifying MAME ROMs\n.\n\n\nPro tip\n: use your favorite websearch engine and look for a \"reference set\" (using ROMs randomly obtained from different sources is a \"trial and error\" method and will most likely lead you to a lot of frustration).\n\n\nWill RetroAchievements support this or that console?\nlink\n\n\nShort answer:\n Yes, it will.\n\n\nLong answer:\n The only correct answer to this question is \"Whenever someone with the skills and desire to code support, does just that.\" - Everyone here is a volunteer so additional support and features happen when they happen. \n\n\nWhat do I do when the achievement isn't working right?\nlink\n\n\nWhen problems with achievements occur, either where the achievement wasn't awarded to you or it was awarded at the wrong time, there are solutions to get the problems fixed and for proper credit to be given to you! First you'll want to \nreport the broken achievement\n. (This is an excellent way to contribute to the betterment of the community!) It creates a ticket report for the achievement developers who will then review the problem and look for a solution.\n\n\nIf the achievement wasn't awarded to you can get it \nmanually awarded\n. You'll need to \nreport the broken achievement\n and provide \nproof of completion\n.\n\n\nHow do I report a broken achievement?\nlink\n\n\nThere are two ways to report broken achievements. In the emulator title bar go to \nRetroAchievements\n \u21d2 \nReport Broken Achievements\n:\n\n\n\n\nFor \nOfficial RetroAchevement emulators\n only:\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor \nRetroArch\n users you can submit the report directly via website. On every achievement's page you'll see a link saying \nReport an issue for this achievement\n, like in the image below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the \nOfficial RetroAchevement emulators\n you can also report problems from the website achievement page, but it is preferred that you use the method built into the emulators. \n\n\nWhat details should I add to a broken achievement report?\nlink\n\n\nIf possible, in the broken achievement report \nComment\n paste a link to a screenshot or video (even better) of where the problem occurred. It's recommended to post screenshots on \nimgur\n and videos on \nYouTube\n.\n\n\nAlso add details like:\n\n\n\n\nwhen it was/wasn't awarded;\n\n\nwhat game mode (HARDCORE/softcore);\n\n\nwhat difficulty level or other settings you've selected;\n\n\nhow long you were playing;\n\n\nwhen you most recently died or continued;\n\n\nwhat you think the problem might be or any details you think could be helpful.\n\n\n\n\nThis is necessary so the achievement developers know where the problem is.\n\n\nHow can I get credit for an achievement I earned but wasn't awarded?\nlink\n\n\nIn short how to request a manual unlock\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use \nDiscord\n\nPost in the \n#help-me\n channel a request that looks similar to one of these:  \n\n\n@manual-unlock \nhttp://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php?i=9577\n HARDCORE Proof: \nhttps://youtu.be/uqD-GTkZbLo\n\n\n@manual-unlock \nhttp://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php?i=16705\n softcore Proof: \nhttps://i.imgur.com/83bJE43.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't use \nDiscord\n \n\nWhile signed into \nRetroAchievments.org\n \nsend a private message\n to the \nRAdmin\n user with the title: \nManual Unlock Request\n\nand a description that looks similar to this:\n\n\nHi. I'm requesting a manual unlock. \nhttp://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php?i=9577\n HARDCORE Proof: \nhttps://youtu.be/uqD-GTkZbLo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn detail how to request a manual unlock\nlink\n\n\n\n\nOpen a ticket describing with details the problem you had with the achievement. (\nHow do I report a broken achievement?\n)\n\n\nIf the achievement wasn't registered on the site due to a network problem, you don't need to open a ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a proof/evidence that you completed the achievement. \nAcceptable proofs\n:\n\n\nScreenshots that show that one is playing in HARDCORE and have completed the achievement.\n\n\nVideo of such (even better)\n (\nperfect example of ideal proof provided by gr1nya\n).\n\n\nExamples of achievements you've earned that prove you've earned this achievement. Example: You got the achievement for 10k points but the one for 5k points wasn't awarded to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're on our discord server, send a message on the \n#help-me\n channel\n tagging the \n@manual-unlock\n role; if you're not on Discord, \nsend a private message message\n to the \nRAdmin\n user. Your message must have:\n\n\nThe link to the ticket url. You can find the ticket here: \nhttp://retroachievements.org/ticketmanager.php\n\n\nWhat mode you were playing (HARDCORE/softcore)\n\n\nLink to your \nqualified proof\n of completion. Include proof that the achievement was earned in HARDCORE, if you were playing in HARDCORE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I got an achievement I didn't earn?\nlink\n\n\nSame with not getting it when you should in most cases you'll want to \ncreate a ticket report\n, leaving an explanation of what went wrong. You'll also want to remove these achievements from your account so you can get the satisfaction of truly earning them.\n\n\n\nResetting unearned achievements\n\n\nAm I the only one with an issue?\nlink\n\n\nIf an achievement doesn't work correctly for you, there is a very good chance it doesn't work for other people. You can check in the achievement's page and look for where it says 'The achievement has 'X' open tickets':\n\n\n\n\nIf the game has tickets, click on the 'open tickets' link. There will be a list to show any reports of broken achievements. You can comment on these to add helpful details or say you have a problem with this achievement too.\n\n\nWhat's considered cheating (for HARDCORE)? What if I find evidence of a cheater?\nlink\n\n\nUsers are required to earn their achievements fairly and legitimately.\n\n\nIn general, a player must unlock achievements:\n\n\n\n\nusing the latest release version of an approved supported emulator;\n\n\ninside of a game by in-game actions;\n\n\nby their own control;\n\n\nwithout outside-modifying game files or game code;\n\n\nwithout using another player\u2019s save file, and;\n\n\nwithout using outside cheat programs.\n\n\n\n\nIf this is not clear enough and you need an in-depth ruleset to understand what is cheating, check the \nGlobal Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules\n.\n\n\nWe live by an honor code most of all. If you find an evidence of a cheater, send the evidence to \nRAdmin\n or email to \nRAmodmail@gmail.com\n.\n\n\nI want to make achievements!\nlink\n\n\nGood to hear!\n The best place to start is here: \nGetting Started as an Achievement Developer\n. Once you're familiar with the Memory Inspector and the other Achievements related dialogs, you can go to other \nDeveloper Docs\n.\n\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask if you need help, don't struggle! The most important thing is to make sure you're enjoying whatever it is you're doing. If you're not having fun, don't do it. But if you get frustrated and want to persist, just drop a message on the \nforums\n or in \nDiscord server\n and someone will get back to you shortly.\n\n\nHow do I reset my password? (If I don't remember my password)\nlink\n\n\nRight Here:\n\nhttps://retroachievements.org/resetPassword.php\n\n\nOn Site, front page, while not logged in:\n\n\n\n\nWill I have any privilege if I become a patron?\nlink\n\n\nOn the website you'll have a badge to mean \"I helped fund RA!\". On the discord server you'll have access to a dedicated channel. Although \nwe are all immensely grateful for the contributions of the patrons\n, there is no other bonus besides those ones.\n\n\nThanks to the \nPatreon contributions\n the RetroAchievements project can pay for a decent server to run the website, run the discord bot and also have periodic backups (to recover data in the event of a disaster), and all this with an ad-free experience. The whole community owe a big thank you to the patrons.\n\n\nIs RetroAchievements profiting off of emulation?\nlink\n\n\nNo. RetroAchievements is a community of devoted fans who want to pay tribute to their favorite games by creating and playing achievements! While we do accept donations through \nPatreon\n all of the money donated is given to fund server expenses and keeping the website completely ad-free. All programmers and developers give their time the betterment of the community at their own expense.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-09-27 19:28] televandalist:\n Updated the PlayStation section to be a general Q&A for unsupported consoles.\n\n\n[2019-05-24 12:21] meleu:\n badge popup on RetroArch\n\n\n[2019-02-27 23:29] Kvon:\n typo\n\n\n[2019-02-24 12:43] meleu:\n RA will be kept completely ad-free (thanks to the Patrons)\n\n\n[2019-02-21 02:11] meleu:\n cosmetic\n\n\n[2019-02-20 07:24] Kvon:\n added an answer to one of the most common FAQ, which is \"why cant I see my new profile pic\n\n\n[2019-01-21 18:52] Kvon:\n fixed a link typo\n\n\n[2019-01-21 18:48] Kvon:\n Changed the formatting for \"In short how to request a manual unlock\" and added a how-to if you don't use Discord.\n\n\n[2019-01-21 16:14] Kvon:\n minor typos\n\n\n[2019-01-21 21:00] meleu:\n fixed broken links",

Pro tip : use your favorite websearch engine and look for a \"reference set\" (using ROMs randomly obtained from different sources is a \"trial and error\" method and will most likely lead you to a lot of frustration).",

            "text": "TL;DR - Golden Rules\nlink\n\n\nParticipants of the \nGlobal Leaderboard\n are required to earn their achievements fairly and legitimately.\n\n\nIn general, a player must unlock achievements:\n\n\n\n\nusing the latest release version of an approved supported emulator;\n\n\ninside of a game by in-game actions;\n\n\nby their own control;\n\n\nwithout outside-modifying game files or game code;\n\n\nwithout using another player\u2019s save files or passwords, and;\n\n\nwithout using outside cheat programs.\n\n\n\n\nThese rules are designed to keep players honest in their gameplay and honest towards each other in \nGlobal Leaderboard\n competition.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nlink\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Leaderboard\n\n\nHardcore mode\n\n\nUntracked\n\n\nNot Allowed\n\n\nAllowed\n\n\nPenalties for Cheating\n\n\nHow to Clean and Appeal Cheating\n\n\nIf You Need Help\n\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Leaderboard\nlink\n\n\nThe RetroAchievements global leaderboard is the main official community competition. This includes a unique site rank based on the sum of achievement points earned in comparison with every other ranked player. Each account with points greater than 0 is ranked by default.\n\n\nWhat is considered fair and legitimate play versus unfair (cheating) on the global leaderboard has been shaped continually by the community since it's inception. The rules below are what we expect from every player who would like to participate in the ranking system. Any indication of a player's failure to follow the rules herein may lose use of the global leaderboard, also known as \nUntracked\n status.\n\n\nHardcore mode\nlink\n\n\nHardcore mode is a feature where the emulator disables \nall\n savestate ability, rewind and the slow motion. The \nfast-forward feature is the only accepted exception\n.\n\n\nWhen playing in hardcore mode the points you earn worth double the achievement's points. So if the achievement set worths 400 points and you complete it in hardcore mode you'll get 800 points.\n\n\nUsers who take the global leaderboard seriously will most likely earn achievements in hardcore mode to get more points.\n\n\nNOTE\n: when playing with hardcore mode disabled (also known as \"softcore\"), expect to have some issues. Read in \nthis link Why you shouldn't use the load state feature\n.\n\n\nUntracked\nlink\n\n\nAn \nuntracked\n account doesn't appear in the global ranking, its activities do not appear in the feed, it's no longer listed among all other earners of each achievement (on the achievement page) and their entries on specific leaderboards will not be publicly visible.\n\n\nHowever an \nuntracked\n account still can enjoy the RetroAchievements and get the badges for completing games.\n\n\nThis status was created so people can do whatever they want with their accounts (like cheating or sharing the account between friends/family) without messing with the fair competitive aspect of the global leaderboards.\nSo, if you want to enjoy the RetroAchievements but not compete in the global leaderboard you can ask to have your account untracked. Just send a message to RAdmin requesting that.\n\n\nNot Allowed\nlink\n\n\n\n\nDo not use methods that circumvent achievement code to instantly unlock achievements.\n\n\nDo not earn achievements in a way that is unintended by the achievement developer.\n\n\nDo not use save files or passwords that are not your own or were made by under other conditions of play.\n\n\nDo not modify the game's file(s) or memory by any means.\n\n\nDo not use game files or programs known as \"trainers\".\n\n\nDo not use TAS (tool-assisted speedrunning), bots, or complex scripting to gain achievements.\n\n\nDo not allow other people to access your account and earn achievements for you.\n\n\nDo not be abusive to developers.\n\n\nDo not create or share cheating methods.\n\n\nDo not use in-game cheat codes unless it is specified as allowed by the developer.\n\n\n\n\n1. Do not use methods that circumvent achievement code to instantly unlock achievements.\nlink\n\n\nEven if you \"should have\" unlocked the achievement. Even if the game is bugged. Even if the achievement is removed or broken entirely. When it's detected it will most likely lead the account to be \nUntracked\n.\n\n\nIn the cases where you should have unlocked the achievement but it didn't triggered or it didn't get registered in the site due to a network problem, you should \nfollow the steps described in FAQ to request a manual unlock\n.\n\n\nNOTE\n: be sure you are using the latest release version of an approved supported emulator.\n\n\n2. Do not earn achievements in a way that is unintended by the achievement developer.\nlink\n\n\nIf you discover a back-door to an achievement this is a bug. Please report this bug using a ticket report.\n\n\nSee also the \nallowed rule 2\n.\n\n\nExamples:\n \n\n\n\n\nYou unlock achievements for finishing levels via a level select cheat code, it's a bug and must be reported/fixed.\n\n\nYou notice that if you go back and forth between two rooms you unlock achievements intended for progressing though the game.\n\n\nYou've found a method of earning a damageless boss achievements while taking damage during the fights.\n\n\n\n\n3. Do not use save files or passwords that are not your own or were made by under other conditions of play.\nlink\n\n\nOccasionally a developer might provide a save file or password for you to use to earn certain achievements. This is appropriate according to the judgement of the set developer.\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nDownloading a clicker game save online.\n\n\nBegging a friend to send you his save file because your house burned down and you lost all your PC files.\n\n\nLoading a save file for Hardcore you created in a while playing on a non-RA emulator.\n\n\n\n\n4. Do not modify the game's file(s) or memory by any means.\nlink\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nOpening up specific game files with a text/hex editor and changing values to what you want; editing properties such as \"read-only\" for game files; etc. \n\n\nEditing the stats or unlocks in a game, and then saving the data.\n\n\n\n\n5. Do not use game files or programs known as \"trainers\".\nlink\n\n\nPrograms which can boost your powers in games, unlock debug modes, speed the game up, modify game code, etc.\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nUsing a trainer program for anything.\n\n\nUsing trained ROMs for any game (they will not be linked).\n\n\nUsing unofficial/old mods/emulators that act as trainers or debug/cheat toolsets.\n\n\nGame Genie / Action Replay and other such similar cheat tools.\n\n\n\n\n6. Do not use TAS (tool-assisted speedrunning), bots, or complex scripting to gain achievements.\nlink\n\n\nThese are all advanced scripting of a game far beyond simple tasks (sometimes even synced to clockspeed) to allow complex, unique, and/or non-monotonous/non-repetitive sections of a game to be played without human interaction.\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nusing a TAS to complete a difficult speedrun or no-death achievement.\n\n\nusing a complex script with advanced functionality.\n\n\nusing complex scripts that complete entire games or large portions of games with no human input but requiring many unique actions.\n\n\n\n\n7. Do not allow other users to access your account and earn achievements for you.\nlink\n\n\nIncluding your \"little brother\" or your \"cousin\". You must earn your achievements yourself. Letting people earn achievements on your account is not allowed in general and if anyone cheats or breaks the rules on your account, you will still be held accountable.\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nHaving a friend who is more skilled at a game complete a difficult section for you in a single-player game.\n\n\nLetting someone log into your RA account to beat a difficult part of a game for you.\n\n\nLetting your little brother work on a grindy achievement for you.\n\n\n\n\n8. Do not be abusive to developers\nlink\n\n\nVia forums, PMs, discord, email, etc. You\u2019re allowed to complain, ask for changes, leave negative reviews/comments and other such respectful criticisms, but you give all of us in the achievement hunting community a really bad name when you harass/attack developers because of what they did to their game\u2019s achievements.\n\n\nExamples\n: Issuing threats or flagrant insults to devs because they added achievements to their game that you do not like; using extreme/excessive rudeness while demanding a developer remove or change achievements; etc.\n\n\n9. Do not create or share cheating methods.\nlink\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nTeaching someone how to use memory hacking tools.\n\n\nPosting on the forums to promote an egregious game file edit method.\n\n\nSending someone a link to memory hacking tools or a trainer programs.\n\n\nTeaching someone how to hide cheating.\n\n\nCreating a non-allowed complex script and sharing it around even if you never use it yourself.\n\n\n\n\n10. Do not use in-game cheat codes unless it is specified as allowed by the developer.\nlink\n\n\nThe other side of the coin for \nallowed 2\n. Cheat codes and debug modes are not allowed unless the developer has made note of which and when it is allowed. Even if the achievements are earnable with cheat codes this is usually unintended behavior, considered cheating if done intentionally, and should be reported as a bug via the ticket system.\n\n\nAllowed\nlink\n\n\n\n\nFast-forward is allowed.\n\n\nWhen explicitly said in achievement's description\n, in-game cheat codes/modes and in-game debug tools are allowed.\n\n\nMaking use of in-game glitches, in-game exploits, and \"cheesy\" tactics are allowed.\n\n\nUsing online guides/walkthroughs is allowed.\n\n\nPlaying co-op/competitive games with another player or players is allowed.\n\n\nTurbo is allowed.\n\n\n\n\n1. Fast-forward is allowed.\nlink\n\n\nEven in hardcore mode fast-forward is allowed, as a modern convenience. It's \nalmost\n a consensus that fast-forward offers no risk to the fairplay and then it's available for everyone to use it.\n\n\nNOTE\n: in \nsoftcore\n mode savestates, rewind and slow motion are also allowed, but expect to have some issues. Read in \nthis link Why you shouldn't use the load state feature\n.\n\n\n2. \nWhen explicitly said in achievement's description\n, in-game cheat codes/modes and in-game debug tools are allowed.\nlink\n\n\nThis is a complement to the \nnot allowed rule 2\n.\n\n\nThe achievement developer's are instructed to \nprotect their work so the achievements can't be unlocked easily by simply using a cheat code\n. However, some cool and fun challenges can be created taking advantage of some cheats. In these specific cases, using in-game cheats are allowed.\n\n\nNOTE\n: if you find achievements unlockable by using in-game cheats with no pertinent description, consider opening a ticket and reporting it.\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nIn \nTetris (Game Boy)\n you should activate the speed cheat to earn the \nChallenge of the Gods\n achievement, where you have to clear 20 lines on speed 19.\n\n\nIn \nGuerrilla War (NES)\n you're allowed to use the \"level and difficulty select screen\" cheat to earn the achievements where you have to beat the stages without killing any hostages.\n\n\n\n\n3. Making use of in-game glitches, in-game exploits, and \"cheesy\" tactics are allowed.\nlink\n\n\nIn-game glitches/exploits/cheesy tactics are allowed, \nhowever developers can code their achievements to disallow them programatically.\n It's usually mentioned in the achievement's description.\n\n\nThis does not include when there are flaws in the achievement developer's code. In such cases, please create a ticket report, and earn the achievement as intended by the developer. See also \nnot allowed rule 2\n.\n\n\nExamples\n:\n\n\n\n\nBreaking out out of normal bounds to avoid enemies.\n\n\nDoing something strange inside of a game to \"bug a game out\" so you become invincible.\n\n\nAccessing powerful items earlier than intended.\n\n\nStanding somewhere enemies can\u2019t hit you.\n\n\n\n\nExamples where developers disallow it\n: Megaman (NES) - beat bosses damageless without using the pause glitch.\n\n\n4. Using online guides/walkthroughs is allowed.\nlink\n\n\nExamples\n: youtube video guides; GameFAQs; puzzle solutions; collectible lists; etc.\n\n\n5. Playing co-op/competitive games with another player or players is allowed.\nlink\n\n\nPlaying co-op is allowed, \nhowever developers can code their achievements to disallow them programatically.\n It's usually mentioned in the achievement's description.\n\n\nSee also \nnot allowed rule 2\n.\n\n\nExamples\n: a skilled friend playing Streets of Rage or Goof Troop with you; etc.\n\n\n6. Turbo is allowed.\nlink\n\n\nTurbo is where you hold a single button down and the button is automatically re-pressed again and again quickly. Turbo is either built into controllers, or into emulation software. In either case it is allowed.\n\n\nIn cases where there is any more complex scripting than repeating the same button in quick succession, this is not allowed. See \nNot allowed 6\n.\n\n\nPenalties for Cheating\nlink\n\n\nUpon cheating being detected, the account will be set as \nUntracked\n. There are some cases where the account will be banned.\n\n\nHow to Clean and Appeal Cheating\nlink\n\n\nThe fastest way: Reset all your points. If you've been previously \nuntracked\n and would like it reversed please inform RAdmin of your action.\n\n\nIf you have ways to prove you played without cheating, send a message to RAdmin, but keep in mind that RA staff are all volunteers and it can take time to judge your case.\n\n\nIf you wish to come forward and admit cheating, this will be greatly appreciated and taken into consideration during your appeal.\n\n\nIf You Need Help\nlink\n\n\nIf you ever have a question, comment, or suggestions - feel welcome to contact RAdmin or the RA staff (@mods and @admins) on our discord server.\n\n\nThese rules will be amended from time to time as needed.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks\nlink\n\n\nThis document is heavily based on the \n100Pals Unified Achievement Hunting Rules\n.

As you may know, this feature isn't allowed when playing with hardcore mode. But some users aren't hardcore gamers and prefer to keep hardcore mode disabled (let's call this mode as softcore).\n\n\nFrom time to time some users \nreport\n that an achievement isn't triggering, and when asked they say they were playing in softcore.\n\n\nOne thing you all have to keep in mind is:\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the load state feature expect to have issues of cheevos not triggering when they are expected to trigger.\n\n\n\n\nHere we'll try to explain for those who don't know the details of achievements development why this kind of issue happen.\n\n\nBasic concept behind an achievement\nlink\n\n\nTechnically an achievement is a group of conditions that must be met in a particular frame of the video game.\n\n\nWhen you launch a game on an emulator with the RetroAchievements feature, the emulator is always checking if those conditions are met in the current frame. When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement.\n\n\nExamples of conditions:\n\n\n\n\nlifebar is full\n\n\nlifebar decreased\n\n\nhave 9 lives\n\n\ncurrently on stage 3\n\n\nat the title screen of the game\n\n\nstarting the boss fight\n\n\nthe game is paused\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with the softcore is that when you load a saved state you can ruin the logic behind an achievement.\n\n\nExamples\nlink\n\n\nExample 1: Beat the game without passwords\nlink\n\n\nImagine a game with 5 stages and with the password feature.\n\n\nProbably the conditions to trigger the \"Beat the game without passwords\" are (in a real cheevo there will be more conditions, but for this explanation let's consider only these ones):\n\n\n\n\nbe at stage 1 (and memorize this event as something that happened)\n\n\nbe at stage 2 (memorize it)\n\n\nbe at stage 3 (memorize it)\n\n\nbe at stage 4 (memorize it)\n\n\nbe at stage 5 (memorize it)\n\n\nfinish stage 5\n\n\n\n\nSo to get this achievement you have to pass through all stages and then beat the game.\n\n\nWhen you are at the stage 1, the emulator memorizes it, same thing for all other stages. And when you finish the stage 5 (beat the game) you get the achievement.\n\n\nNow imagine this scenario:\n\n\n\n\na softcore player started the game and played stages 1, 2 and 3\n\n\nhe needed to stop playing when at stage 4 and then he saved a state to continue later\n\n\nhe closed the emulator\n\n\nlater he could play again, started the game and loaded the state he saved\n\n\nplayed stages 4, 5 and beated the game\n\n\n\n\nIn this scenario the achievement won't trigger.\n\n\nAfter closing the emulator it \"forgets\" that you passed through stages 1, 2 and 3. When you run the emulator/game again and load the state being on stage 4, the emulator won't detect that you passed through the previous stages. Then the achievement won't trigger.\n\n\nExample 2: Defeat boss X without taking damage\nlink\n\n\nMost likely the conditions to be met in a frame to make this achievement trigger are:\n\n\n\n\nentered the boss room (and memorize this event as something that happened).\n\n\nif take any damage, forget it entered the boss room.\n\n\nbeat the boss.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words: to get this achievement the emulator must \"know\" that you entered the boss room, didn't get any damage, and beated the boss.\n\n\nThe important detail to pay attention here: when you get any damage, the emulator \"forgets\" that you entered the boss room. Then even if you load a state to a point where you didn't get any damage but already entered the room, the emulator won't detect that you entered the room. And then the achievement won't trigger.\n\n\nFinal Words\nlink\n\n\nWhen \nreporting a broken achievement\n give as many details as possible, \nand don't forget to mention if you are playing on hardcore mode or not\n.\n\n\nIf you want to request an admin to manually award to you an achievement that didn't triggered, be sure to provide a qualified proof.

Keep in mind that changes come for a better quality.\n\n\n\n\nNow let's elaborate why we are saying that.\n\n\nRetroAchievements is a \"young\" project and is constantly evolving. It was launched in the late 2012, and in the early days the emulators and the site (database stuff, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) were developed by a single person: \nScott\n. Therefore the evolution occurred slowly.\n\n\nAnother thing that was occurring very slowly in the early days was the diffusion of knowledge about achievement creation. Specially about good practices when creating achievements. There wasn't documentation at that time (RADocs only started in November/2017). People were learning to create achievements by sharing knowledge on forum threads and/or by personal messages.\n\n\nIn the early days the community didn't have a very clear a concept of what a good achievement design is. And it resulted in many poorly designed sets compared to our current standards (e.g. sets with only progress-based achievements). We also didn't have much experience of how achievements could be protected against in-game cheats or battery save abusing. That's why from time to time some achievement sets receive revisions. \nWe make set revisions with quality in mind, and to show actual respect for the game\n.\n\n\nWhen a revision is going to happen, we try to involve the community by discussing on our forums (usually the official game's topic) and/or on our discord server. We are aware that this is insufficient to reach all interested people, but it is the way we are currently using.\n\n\nWe are working on new ways to discuss revisions with the community by implementing some new social features on the RA website, but while those features are not implemented, we'll keep using the forums and discord.\n\n\nIf you would like to propose new methods for discussing revisions, we are open to suggestions.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2018-10-11 00:27] CoolCanuck:\n https    (ps we love you, Scott kthx)\n\n\n[2018-04-27 02:52] meleu:\n fixed some typos and other cosmetics\n\n\n[2018-04-26 20:49] meleu:\n Created A message for Achievement Hunters and Completionists about revisions (markdown)",

Due to their prominence on game and user pages they are worth special attention.\n\n\n\n\nSonic the Hedgehog's game Icon\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nDesigning new game Icons - styling guide\nlink\n\n\nWhen designing a new game icon consider the following: Much of the community prefers that \ngame Icons use art assets that were made for the original game;\n\n- from inside the game, \n- or for the game documents, \n- or for the game manual, \n- or for promotional material,\n- and so on; art created by the original team.\n\n\nUsing more current designs (or fan art) for classic video game characters might be seem appealing. But many find this is \ndisrespectful to the source material\n.\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility for the styling guide\nlink\n\n\n\n\nFor unlicensed games or \n~hacks~\n where there is little original art available non-official art might be reasonable.\n\n\nMaking modifications to the art assets available for would usually be reasonable.\n\n\nUsing outside or hand-made assets, say for a title or border, would be reasonable so long as the main subject uses official art.\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to follow this styling guide?\nlink\n\n\nThe style you choose for your designs is still up to you. You can break these rules so long as you do not break any copyright law, or upload anything vulgar, offensive or pornographic.\n\n\nOther Icon Design tips\nlink\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the \ngames list\n, to find Icons that speak to you. Mimic and innovate on the style of your favorites.\n\n\nMany of the \nBadge creation tips\n apply here as well.\n\n\n\n\nIcon file and size - best practices\nlink\n\n\n\n\nUploaded Icons should be square (have the same X and Y dimensions), otherwise the resulting image will be distorted and ugly.\n\n\nUpload using non-interlaced PNG format; avoid using a transparency layer as it will come out in the end with a flat white box.\n\n\nDesign images at 96x96 (preferred), 64x64, 48x48 or 32x32 for sharpest clarity. Icons and badges should be made in a way that the subject is clear even when sized at 32x32 as they are often reduced to this size, like on the global feed.\n\n\n\n\nUploading game Icons (Developer)\nlink\n\n\nAchievement Developers are allowed to change game Icons freely for entries that do not have achievements. As a Developer if you'd like to post a backup of the previous image there, if there is one, or backup yours in the forum you're free to but not required. As you create a new set of achievement you are free to create or choose the image you'd like to use as the game Icon.\n\n\nTo change a game Icon first go to the game page and click on the Dev tools:\n\n\n\n\nThen click the choose file button highlighted. Find the file on your PC, and then press the submit button highlighted:\n\n\n\n\nIf a game has existing achievements game Icon changes need to go through the \nIcon Gauntlet\n.\n\n\nUploading game Icons (non-Developer)\nlink\n\n\nYes, you absolutely can, but read the rules for the \nIcon Gauntlet\n. It will also be good to review the guidelines for \ndesigning new game Icons\n.\n\n\nGame Icon Gauntlet\nlink\n\n\nThe game Icon Gauntlet pits a user posted new Icons and Badges in a \nhead-to-head\n fight with the standing Icon. The \npopular vote\n which will take place in the \n#Icon-Gauntlet\n Discord channel and will determine which stays and which goes. All verified Discord users are eligible to cast their deciding vote. \nDrPixel\n is the manager of all aspects of this on ongoing contest.\n\n\nRules for Submitting a new game Icon\nlink\n\n\n\n\nAny verified RetroAchievments user can submit a new game Icon or Badges.\n\n\nOnly submit Icons and Badges for games that have existing achievements.\n\n\nIcon and Badge submissions must be related to the game or achievements; no lewd graphics.\n\n\nRecommended:\n Icons are best created at 96x96, 64x64 or 32x32. Create PNG image files for best quality.\n\n\nRecommended:\n Badges are best created at 64x64 or 32x32. Create PNG image files for best quality.\n\n\nPost them in \nthis forum topic\n.\n\n\nTo properly display the image post it using the image forum tag \n[img=http://YourImageURL.png]\n\n\nState the game that your Icon or Badges are intended to replace. (Even better use the \n[game=GameID]\n forum tag. You can see the game id by looking at the url of the game page)\n\n\nWhen posting a new set of Badges, post all the new images along side the old ones so they can easily be presented side-by-side publicly.\n\n\n\n\nThe Icon Gauntlet Vote\nlink\n\n\n\n\nThe vote takes place in the \n#Icon-Gauntlet\n Discord channel and open is to all Verified \n(green name)\n Discord users.\n\n\nNew votes are posted weekly and the vote lasts for the week.\n\n\nMajority wins.\n\n\nIn the event of a tie, there will be a revote.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to the image when you upload a game Icon\nlink\n\n\nWhen uploaded, your Icon images are reduced to a maximum 96x96 32-bit colour PNG. If you upload an Icon that is smaller than 96x96 the image uploaded will retain its original size. \n\n\nThe same is true for Badges, except Badges maximum size is 64x64. (Profile images maximum is 128x128.)\n\n\nIcon server files\nlink\n\n\nIcons are stored on the site in the following manner and place: \ni.retroachievements.org/Images/000705.png\n. They are stored in the same server folder as other game images such as the game box and game screenshots. \n\n\nAchievement Badges\nlink\n\n\nBadges are the user created images for individual achievements of a game.\n\n\n\n\nSonic the Hedgehog's first Badge - #00199)\n\n  ## \n\n\n\n\nBadge creation guidelines and tips\nlink\n\n\n\n\nBadges should refer in some way to what the achievement is about - i.e. a picture of the boss, level or collectible that the achievement requires the player to get to. \n\n\nCheck out the designs of some of your favorite games. Some users go to great effort to make visually appealing badges:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a \nforum topic\n full of great tips. \n\n\nIn the cases of low-resolution games' achievements, it can be hard to get a Badge looking good without it looking \nblocky\n or \nblurry\n, in these cases the \nblocky\n look is often preferable, so that the images have a \nretro\n feel to them.\n\n\nYou can make each Badge have little rounded borders like an actual Badge or some extra spiky corners for emphasis or a king's crown for difficult ones.  Its your design.  It should visually represent the achievement itself, or hint at the location in the game for secrets.\n\n\nMatching to the game's art style works well. Google Image searches for \"Sprite Sheets\" is another useful tip to include some game art.\n\n\n\n\nBadge file and size - best practices\nlink\n\n\n\n\nUploaded Badges should be square (have the same X and Y dimensions), otherwise the resulting image will be distorted and ugly.\n\n\nUpload using non-interlaced PNG format; avoid using a transparency layer as it will come out in the end with a flat white box.\n\n\nDesign images at 64x64, 48x48 or 32x32 for sharpest clarity. Badges should be made in a way that the subject is clear even when sized at 32x32, as they are often reduced to this size, like on the global feed.\n\n\n\n\nUploading a Badge for new achievements (Developer)\nlink\n\n\nIf you are creating new achievements you are free to upload badges for them. \n\n\nBadges are uploaded from within the emulator developer tools while in the achievement editor:\n\n\n\n\nOr you can select a prefabricated image or find other images you've uploaded in the drop down box:\n\n\n\n\nUpload \n.jpg\n, \n.jpg\n or \n.gif\n file types. It's not entirely important how the file is formatted before uploading, but it is strongly recommended that it be square.\n\n\nIf the game has existing badges review and follow the procedure for \nUploading Badges (Non-Developer)\n.\n\n\nMaking new Badges for existing achievements\nlink\n\n\nIf you'd like to make improved badges for existing achievement you can. Your images will go through the (Game Icon Gauntlet)[#game-icon-gauntlet], which will put your creations to a community vote.\n\n\nPost all the new images you'd like to replace current ones in the \nIcon Gauntlet Forum Topic\n. Also post all the badges that the new images are meant to replace. They will be placed for a community review by as a single vote. After a community vote is complete if you are a dev you can replace the Badges or if you are not, ask for help in the #help-me channel on Discord or in the \nIcon Gauntlet Forum Topic\n.\n\n\nIt's easiest to just reference the old and new Badges as \nimg\n links:\n- Example: \n[img=https://retroachievements.org/Badge/01234.png] -> [img=https://retroachievements.org/badge/56789.png]\n\n- (Dev) Make sure to capture the old Badge ID from the Achievement Editor before uploading the new Badge\n- The new Badge ID will appear in the Achievement Editor after uploading it.\n- Both values can also be captured from the web site, but you have to copy the image links as the hover link is for the achievement.\n\n\nHere is a perfect example of \nhow to effectively post new and old Badges\n.\n\n\nWhat happens to the image when you upload a Badge\nlink\n\n\nWhen uploaded, your file is converted into the following:\n- 64x64 32-bit colour PNG. Example:\n\n\n![00136](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8508804/37221161-b9b0bb02-23a7-11e8-81b2-3d09fa7456af.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64x64 greyscale and blurred PNG. Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadge Server Files\nlink\n\n\nThey are stored on site in the following manner and place: \ni.retroachievements.org/Badge/00136.png\n; the number coincidences with the badge ID found in the Achievement.\n\n\nWhere you'll see Badges and Icons are displayed\nlink\n\n\n\n\nOn leaderboards: 96x96 (Icon only)\n\n\nIn RA Emulators 64x64\n\n\nGame Pages: 96x96\n\n\nUser Pages: 48x48\n\n\nCurrently Playing (front page), New Achievements, Similar Games: 32x32\n\n\n\n\nThe actual images are not being resized. The image is scaled by the browser to the display size. Some browsers such as Android's browser will display larger images more clearly. You can also increase your browser zoom to see them more clearly.\n\n\nIt's anticipated that in a future website version, Icons and Badges will be displayed at full size in other places.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-11-17 22:14] meleu:\n remove Table of Contents (it was bad formatted)\n\n\n[2019-08-08 04:05] Kvon:\n Badge and Icon Creation; minor typo\n\n\n[2019-08-08 04:04] Kvon:\n Badge and Icon Creation: Changed policy to put all new badges though the icon gauntlet.

In the cases of low-resolution games' achievements, it can be hard to get a Badge looking good without it looking  blocky  or  blurry , in these cases the  blocky  look is often preferable, so that the images have a  retro  feel to them.  You can make each Badge have little rounded borders like an actual Badge or some extra spiky corners for emphasis or a king's crown for difficult ones.  Its your design.  It should visually represent the achievement itself, or hint at the location in the game for secrets.  Matching to the game's art style works well.

How to Reserve\nlink\n\n\nThe only way to reserve a game is by clearly stating your goal to create achievements in the official forum topic of the game on a new post.\n\n\n\n\nNo other declarations, plans or lists posted anywhere else are to be considered in this.\n\n\nCode notes do not reserve a game (if you have added notes but not reserved the game in the forum, any other developer is free to work on it).\n\n\nIt is recommended that post a list of planned achievements, so the community can review your work and give you feedback.\n\n\n\n\n2. Concurrent Reservations Limit\nlink\n\n\nAs in the maximum number of achievement sets one developer can have reserved at once.\n\n\n\n\nJunior Developer\n: 1.\n\n\nDeveloper\n: 4.\n\n\nVeteran Developer\n: 8 (a Veteran Developer is someone who is Developer for at least 18 months \nand\n has published at least 20 achievement sets).\n\n\nNote:\n Working on an approved revision or joining another developer in a cooperative effort does not reduce from this total.\n\n\n\n\n3. Reservation Timing\nlink\n\n\n\n\nOnly reserve a game for development when you start working on it. In other words, do not reserve games just to block others from working on it.\n\n\nPlease reserve the set as soon as you begin working and not as you are finishing your work.\n\n\n\n\n4. Reservation Renewals\nlink\n\n\nYou can renew your reservation every three months (+/- 2 weeks) if you've not finished your set.\n\n\n\n\nTo renew the reservation, post about it on the official game's forum topic.\n\n\nDo not edit your previous declarations, but make a new post talking about your current progress.\n\n\nAvoid locking down a set indefinitely. If it appears a developer continues to delay development on a set with little or no progress the staff may intervene.\n\n\n\n\n5. Respecting Reservations\nlink\n\n\nDo not ask, pressure or discourage anyone from working on any game, in public or in private (of course, assuming the person is already following all other standards on this Code of Conduct).\n\n\n6. Reservation Cool-Down\nlink\n\n\nAfter the time you've reserved a set wait at least 48 hours before you publish it. This allows reservation review and to clear up any possible reservation disputes.\n\n\nImportant Notes\nlink\n\n\n\n\nIf you post a complete plan, be open to suggestions; you can get excellent input and suggestions this way.\n\n\nYou must adhere to the \nBasic Achievement Design Guidelines\n, otherwise your set won't be allowed.\n\n\nWhen you publish your work you are giving it over to the community to be reviewed and reworked over time.\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLet others know if you welcome collaborators.\n\n\nIf you've recently reserved a set and someone else voices desire to work on a set that you've reserved within the last 72 hours (beyond suggesting ideas), consider ways in which you can collaborate with them.\n\n\nIf someone reserved a game you're interested in before you, don't get frustrated. You are encouraged to request collaboration. You can post your desire to collaborate in the forum or send them a message to get permission from them to publish your contributions. You can also wait and go through an \nAchievement Set Revision\n after the set is published.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Achievement Design Guidelines\nlink\n\n\nUnwelcome Concepts\nlink\n\n\nYou can (and should) be as creative as you can, but there are some concepts that are \nNOT\n welcome for achievements, such as:\n\n\n\n\nRequire glitches (acceptable in \nBonus sets\n). \n\n\nRequire two players.\n\n\nRequire perfection all game (\nmaybe\n acceptable in \nBonus Sets\n).\n\n\nDying (simply), or playing bad without any purpose.\n\n\nNSFW content in text or image.\n\n\nAchievements popping frequently with little effort from the player (including multiple achievements for doing the same task, such as one for beating a boss and another one for getting the item left by the boss, etc.)\n\n\nAchievements obtainable with zero effort for no meaningful purpose (example: start the game as character X, collect one coin). It's acceptable if there's something fun/historical/interesting you want to address.\n\n\nRequire excessive repetitive grinding, such as reaching level 99 in an RPG, for no meaningful purpose (\nmaybe\n acceptable in \nBonus Sets\n).\n\n\nRely entirely on randomness, especially when there are extremely low odds. However, for games where the randomness is a major aspect, it may be appropriate.\n\n\n\"Secret Achievements\", where the players have no indication of what they're going after. If you want to prevent spoilers give at least a clue on the Achievement Title/Description. Otherwise the players will start to search on web or mess with Achievement Editor/Memory Inspector, and in the process they can stumble across even worse spoilers.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: With every rule, there's an exception. This is especially true with unwelcome concepts. All unwelcome concepts have some wiggle room. when in doubt consult with the admin team.\n\n\nEvery Achievement Set MUST Have\nlink\n\n\nProtection\n for situations where the players can get achievements without effort, such as:\n\n\n\n\nDemo mode;\n\n\nIngame cheat codes;\n\n\nBattery saves;\n\n\nPasswords.\n\n\n\n\nSee also\n: \nAchievement Templates\n and \nReal Examples\n for some well known protection techniques.\n\n\nEvery Achievement Set SHOULD Have\nlink\n\n\n\n\nAt least basic \nRich Presence\n; \n\n\nGame Badges for each achievement; \n\n\nAll game page information filled out, and game images uploaded.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Rich Presence, Leaderboards, and game page images/information can only be added by full developers\n\n\nRecommended but not required\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLeaderboards for scores and time challenges.\n\n\nMissable achievements flagged, especially for RPGs and long games. \n\n\nUse \n[m]\n in the end of achievement's title to flag it as missable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn achievement guide. Guides can be created and posted \nhere\n. \n\n\nFor games with text-triggered achievements (especially RPGs) it's recommend to find an event flag instead of hooking onto text or text ID. Text presentation varies between regional versions making multi-region support difficult.\n\n\n\n\nAchievement Scoring\nlink\n\n\nWhen \nscoring\n achievements match your scores to one of these 5 tiers. There is no achievment set point cap. \n\n\n\n\n0-5 Easy / Minor Significance  \n\n\n10 Medium / Intermediate Significance  \n\n\n25 Hard / Major Significance  \n\n\n50 Very Hard / Completion Level Significance  \n\n\n100 \"Impossible\" (Typically for bonus sets)  \n\n\n\n\nWhen scoring there are other \nfactors to be considered\n, such as achievement spread and game length.\n\n\nTools to Help you Succeed\nlink\n\n\nWe have a \nroadmap\n you can use as a guideline to create a good achievement set.\n\nWe also have an \nachievement design guide\n on how to design good achievements, not the technical side but the conceptual. Creating a balanced set is one of the most difficult aspects of development, we have a \nset balance guide\n which will help you in thinking about how to create a set that flows.\n\n\nIt is preferable and recommended to work on one set at a time. But if you have more, be open for a teamwork or even delegate the set creation if another dev contacts you.\n\n\nRevisions - Working on Sets with Existing Achievements\nlink\n\n\nRevisions, as in working on a set that has existing achievements typically requires community approval by presenting your plan in the forum and in the \n#revision-voting\n channel in Discord. Not all changes need approval. See \nAchievement Set Revisions\n for details.\n\n\nCode Notes\nlink\n\n\nLeave accurate code notes for each address you use for achievement conditions. This helps you and others maintain the set, keeping it free of bugs.\n\n\nYou're free to add any code notes you discover to any set without declaring intentions to work on the game. Just be careful to not delete previous notes added by someone else.\n\n\nHandling Tickets\nlink\n\n\nAfter you've published achievements be prepared for bug reports.\n\n\nYou're expected to keep your work bug free by appropriately resolving tickets. Respond to all tickets as soon as possible. The sooner you respond the better, cause the problem is fresh in the player's mind and you can use them to help you to resolve the problem.\n\n\nWhile resolving tickets, leave a brief summary of what you did. If you have an indication of false report leave a message showing what conclusions you've made, and then close the ticket. \nClosing/Resolving a ticket without leaving any comments is an unwelcome attitude.\n\n\nDo not declare your plans to work on a game if you have open tickets.\n\n\nIf you want to resolve tickets or fix bugs on achievements made by another developer, it's always a good practice to try to contact them and check if they are still active before changing their work. \nAn inactive developers is someone who have have 10 or more open tickets that are older than two months\n (you can see their open tickets from the Ticket Manager).\n\n\nIf the developer is active, you can assist them in the resolution.\n\n\nIf the developer is inactive you can freely resolve their tickets. However you're only allowed to fix the achievement to match the description; \ndo not change the intention of the achievement without going through the revision process\n.\n\n\nDeveloper Status Extended Inactivity\nlink\n\n\nIf a developer is inactive for two years or longer, meaning within two years they have not created any new achievements or resolved any incoming tickets, their developer status will expire.\n\n\nIf this happens to you, you are very welcome to come back to the scene if you want to create new content for our community. First you'll want to review and understand this document (the Developer Code of Conduct). When you feel ready to adhere to it, message us to user \nRAdmin\n (a shared admin mail account) here on site or speak to the admin or mod users on the \nRetroAchievements Discord server\n to check how to get your developer status back.\n\n\nAchievement Ownership\nlink\n\n\nWhen you publish your work you are giving it over to the community\n to be reviewed and reworked over time - see \nAchievement Set Revisions\n. \n\n\nWhile the original developer does not own published achievements they are still the caretaker in terms of bug fixing and maintenance. If another developer revises the achievement they are the new caretaker of that achievement.\n\n\nFeedback about the Developer's Code of Conduct\nlink\n\n\nAlthough the Developer's Code of Conduct is the result of an intense debate, it's not an immutable document. If you have suggestions for improvements, contact us on our Discord server or send a message to \nRAdmin\n.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-08-17 14:37] meleu:\n fix markdown formats\n\n\n[2019-08-13 19:50] Kvon:\n Code of conduct: text hooking tip\n\n\n[2019-08-01 14:50] Kvon:\n Developer Code of Conduct: Slight rewording of \"important notes\" added a \"collaboration\" sub-section.\n\n\n[2019-08-01 14:44] Kvon:\n Developers code of conduct: Added a point encouraging collaboration\n\n\n[2019-07-11 08:46] Kvon:\n DevCoC: Added achievement scoring, put back in reservation time limit (48 hours instead of 72), formatting and titles\n\n\n[2019-07-07 20:53] Kvon:\n Dev CoC: 3 changes to simplify reservations for devs. 3 months instead of 2 for renewals; reservations do not REQUIRE set plans; 72 hour waiting period is removed.

While resolving tickets, leave a brief summary of what you did. If you have an indication of false report leave a message showing what conclusions you've made, and then close the ticket.  Closing/Resolving a ticket without leaving any comments is an unwelcome attitude.  Do not declare your plans to work on a game if you have open tickets.  If you want to resolve tickets or fix bugs on achievements made by another developer, it's always a good practice to try to contact them and check if they are still active before changing their work.  An inactive developers is someone who have have 10 or more open tickets that are older than two months  (you can see their open tickets from the Ticket Manager).  If the developer is active, you can assist them in the resolution.  If the developer is inactive you can freely resolve their tickets.

            "text": "Welcome to the world of Achievement Creation!\n\n\nBasic Concepts\nlink\n\n\nTechnically \nan achievement is a group of conditions that must be met in a particular frame of the video game\n.\n\n\nWhen you launch a game on an emulator with the RetroAchievements feature, the emulator is always checking if those conditions are met in the current frame. When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement.\n\n\nThe process of creating an achievement basically involves 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a place in the game's RAM where the information you want is stored (examples: level, life bar, time, coins, holding a weapon, get an item, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate conditions that must be met in order to award an Achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest if your achievement is working as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost likely you'll go back to step 2 and 3 many times to refine the logic of your Achievement.\n\n\nIn this doc we'll see how to accomplish the steps above.\n\n\nAfter you're sure your achievement is triggering at the conditions you want, you can submit it to the server. We'll see more about it later.\n\n\nFirst Steps\nlink\n\n\nBefore start ensure you have an RA emulator from the \nRetroAchievements Download Page\n first and \ncreate an account\n so you can log in using the emulator.\n\n\nIn this guide we'll be using RAGens to demonstrate, and the game \nSonic the Hedgehog\n. We are using RAGens but the same applies for the other emulators.\n\n\nTo begin, run the RAGens executable, and login when prompted. Next, use File -> Open and select whatever ROM you would like to find achievements for.\n\n\nMemory Inspector\nlink\n\n\nYou should now have your main window running Sonic. There are 3 other dialogs we'll be using, which can be found under \nRetroAchievements\n in the menu. We'll be dealing with the \nMemory Inspector\n first:\n\n\n\n\nThe Memory Inspector can be used to find addresses in RAM for us to use. Essentially you are on a treasure hunt for memory locations - this dialog will help you examine and filter the game's RAM while the game is running.\n\n\nNOTE: If you want a step-by-step video explanation on finding memory addresses, \nthis old video\n can be useful\n.\n\n\nSee also\n: \nMemory Inspector Overview\n and \nMemory Digging Tips\n.\n\n\nTo start or restart a test, click \nNew 8-bit Test\n near the top middle.\n\n\nTo keep things simple, we'll start by looking for the memory address which holds the number of rings we have collected. Our steps will be the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad the ROM and start a new game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset the memory dialog: click \nNew 8-bit Test\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to the game and change the number of rings in memory. For example, collect a ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the memory dialog, we now want to filter for values that are 'greater than previous values' (symbol \n>\n). We select this, then hit \nFilter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach time you perform 3 then 4, the number of possibilities or 'candidates' will get smaller. We will continue doing this until the number of candidates reaches a very small number (as few as possible), it might take 4-5 attempts. Next we can click in the results window, and monitor the memory address in the memory viewer at the bottom. Continue using the game and you should see the values in memory change as you collect rings. If you don't, or if something doesn't look right, try another value. With the first Sonic the Hedgehog, the memory address for the number of rings should be \n0xfe20\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1\n: Using save states (F5 to save state, F8 to load state, F6-F7 to toggle which state to use), you can switch back and forth between different states allowing you to alter what is in RAM, and use this to filter out bad candidates. You can search for values that remain the same (I.e. If you know the value didn't change, use \n=\n), or values that are different (use 'not equal', symbol \n!=\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2\n: There's unfortunately no guarantee from game to game on how the developers have stored their data (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, binary-coded decimals, negative/inverted, i.e. using 0xff/0xffff to represent 'set', or plain randomly), but eventually you should come across some good address. Note if you are struggling to find good values, post \nRetroAchievements.org Development Help forum\n, or \nRetroAchievements Discord server\n. There are plenty of people who will be very happy to help!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n: if you'd like to experiment with memory, try entering new values directly into the RAM viewer. This can have devastating effects on the game, or it might do exactly what you expect, (or nothing at all!) It can be useful though, to see if you can enter a value and get the result you expect. Use with caution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you've found an address you're happy with, you can write a short note for what it is and hit \nSave Note\n, this will store it on database, and will be automatically restored next time you load up the memory viewer for this game, wherever you are! Note that after clicking 'Save Note', the note will be automatically stored on the database, and shared so all developers will share access to these memory notes. They will all be downloaded afresh when you load a ROM. If you try to overwrite a note, it will check with you first before submitting.\n\n\nYou can find more useful \nMemory Digging Tips here\n.\n\n\nAchievement Sets\nlink\n\n\nOK so the memory location for the number of rings is stored at \n0xfe20\n - note to a non-programmer, we're dealing in \nhexadecimal numeral system\n which can be daunting, but don't worry, essentially its just numbers and letters instead of only numbers, and not forgetting \n0x\n at the start to show that it's a memory location in hex. We've found an address we're interested in and stored it using \nSave Note\n. We now want to create a new achievement.\n\n\nGo to the \nRetroAchievements\n in the menu, choose \nAchievement Sets\n and you'll see this dialog:\n\n\n\n\nHere we group all the achievements we know about into three sets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Achievements (the main, public Achievement set),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnofficial/User Achievements (public, but will not award you points: for peer review),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Achievements (personal to your PC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Achievements dialog, click \nLocal Achievements\n (top left), then \nAdd New Achievement\n (top right). This will add a blank entry to the list in the center. Double click on it: if it's not already open, this should select it and open the \nAchievement Editor\n dialog.\n\n\nAchievement Editor\nlink\n\n\nThis is how it looks:\n\n\n\n\nThis is the final dialog where we bring all the data together. Most of the top fields are self explanatory, I.e. Title, Description, Points. The main one is the 'Requirements' part.\n\n\nLet's say we want to add an achievement for collecting a certain number of rings. Let's say 15 rings for simplicity. After filling out the fields at the top and selecting a suitable icon (in this example we used the gold trophy badge (00136), but you can upload a new one), we need to fill out Requirements. We have one requirement, \nthat the number of rings is at least 15\n. Next click is \nAdd New Requirement\n.\n\n\nClicking this button will add several default values to the Requirements list. These defaults just ensure that something relatively sensible is added to the list. For now, ignoring the field 'Special?'. When we clicked create, the default memory value will be whatever value you last left in the memory dialog.\n\n\nNext we will change these values to the following:\n\n\n\n\nSize\n: \n16-bit\n\n\nMemory\n: \n0xfe20\n\n\nCmp\n: \n>=\n - this is the comparison to make. We could have any comparison here, but it's sensible to have \"greater than or equal to\". This is important because if we get 10 rings then a super ring box to have 20, we would miss out having \nexactly\n 15 rings.\n\n\nType\n: \nValue\n - we're comparing this memory value to a fixed value: 15\n\n\nSize\n: \nEmpty\n - this is only relevant when comparing memory to memory\n\n\nMem/Val\n: \n15\n - the number of rings required: the value we are comparing the memory to\n\n\nHit Count\n: \n0\n - ignore this for now, its useful for when something needs to happen a certain number of times\n\n\n\n\nWith that set, we don't have any more conditions to add, so we return to the \nAchievements Dialog\n. To be safe, we should save our progress by hitting \nSave Local\n! This saves everything to file locally to ensure that we won't lose any progress.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: usually achievements have more than one requirement to avoid it triggering in a wrong time (i.e. playing demo mode). In this example we are using only one requirement just to simplify the explanation. See more \nAchievement Creation Tips here\n.\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Achievement\nlink\n\n\nWe can now 'activate' this achievement locally by hitting \nActivate\n on the right-hand side. This will start monitoring these memory locations and will award the achievement once all the conditions are true. Now we can go ahead and test to see if this achievement works!\n\n\n\n\nIf we press \nEsc\n n-game, you will see the achievement show up as a demonstration of what it would look like in the in-game overlay!\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the achievement worked fine in our tests, an achievement with a logic like that is not ready to be officially released. First of all: it has only one condition: \"collected rings >= 15\". The problem is that the memory address used to record the number of collected rings is also used when the game runs in \"demo mode\" (AI playing the game after your wait a while on the title screen). So, if Sonic collect 15 rings on demo mode this achievement will trigger, which is unwanted.\n\n\nCheck the tips in the next section below to know how to improve the logic of your achievement and then make it accepted to be officially released.\n\n\nImportant Tips\nlink\n\n\nSo here are some tips you have to keep in mind when creating your achievements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever\n Avoid to make achievements with only one condition as much as you can\n. Otherwise it will most likely pop at the wrong time. This is the \nmost common error by a developer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the game has a \ndemo mode\n (AI plays the game after you wait a while on the title screen), make sure to \nfind the address for it\n and add a condition so your achievements don't trigger in demo mode. You'll also need to know how to use \nPauseIf\n and \nResetIf\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf\n cheat codes\n: If the game has a cheat code to increase lives, select stages, etc. Make sure to find the addresses for it and add some kind of protection in your achievements. OK, maybe it's not a very basic topic, but you have to keep it in mind when creating an official achievement set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid creating achievements for just entering on a stage.\n As it can be earned by a password or a stage select cheat code. Prefer to make achievements for finishing a stage, \nlike in this template here\n. Also, \ndo not create achievements for just starting a game or \"starting a game with character X\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanna create an achievement for getting a specific and unique item in the game, add some conditions to make sure the player got the item where it is supposed to be obtained, \nlike in this template here\n. Otherwise the achievement will be earnable using password or loading a saved game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid making too many achievements about simple things that need near to no effort\n. Examples of what \nNOT\n to do: get one coin or one mushroom on Super Mario Bros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe aware of the \nunwelcome achievement's design concepts\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe creative with your achievements\n. Those covering unique features and details of the game are the most welcome. The players love when that little detail of a game they love is supported on an achievement. Reading a Walkthrough on \nGameFAQs\n can give some inspiration too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry spending on the game as much of the time as possible, especially if it's your first attempt on developing achievements. It takes time to know the game more from the inside, and how the memory works there is the best source of ideas for unique achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more in the \nTips and Tricks page\n.\n\n\nNext Steps\nlink\n\n\nNow that you know how to use the Memory Inspector, and the Achievement Editor.

When you launch a game on an emulator with the RetroAchievements feature, the emulator is always checking if those conditions are met in the current frame. When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement.  The process of creating an achievement basically involves 3 steps:    Finding a place in the game's RAM where the information you want is stored (examples: level, life bar, time, coins, holding a weapon, get an item, etc.).    Create conditions that must be met in order to award an Achievement.    Test if your achievement is working as expected.    Most likely you'll go back to step 2 and 3 many times to refine the logic of your Achievement.  In this doc we'll see how to accomplish the steps above.  After you're sure your achievement is triggering at the conditions you want, you can submit it to the server. We'll see more about it later.",

            "text": "You should now have your main window running Sonic. There are 3 other dialogs we'll be using, which can be found under  RetroAchievements  in the menu. We'll be dealing with the  Memory Inspector  first:   The Memory Inspector can be used to find addresses in RAM for us to use. Essentially you are on a treasure hunt for memory locations - this dialog will help you examine and filter the game's RAM while the game is running.  NOTE: If you want a step-by-step video explanation on finding memory addresses,  this old video  can be useful .  See also :  Memory Inspector Overview  and  Memory Digging Tips .  To start or restart a test, click  New 8-bit Test  near the top middle.  To keep things simple, we'll start by looking for the memory address which holds the number of rings we have collected. Our steps will be the following:    Load the ROM and start a new game.    Reset the memory dialog: click  New 8-bit Test .    Return to the game and change the number of rings in memory. For example, collect a ring.    In the memory dialog, we now want to filter for values that are 'greater than previous values' (symbol  > ). We select this, then hit  Filter .    Each time you perform 3 then 4, the number of possibilities or 'candidates' will get smaller. We will continue doing this until the number of candidates reaches a very small number (as few as possible), it might take 4-5 attempts. Next we can click in the results window, and monitor the memory address in the memory viewer at the bottom. Continue using the game and you should see the values in memory change as you collect rings. If you don't, or if something doesn't look right, try another value. With the first Sonic the Hedgehog, the memory address for the number of rings should be  0xfe20 .    Note 1 : Using save states (F5 to save state, F8 to load state, F6-F7 to toggle which state to use), you can switch back and forth between different states allowing you to alter what is in RAM, and use this to filter out bad candidates. You can search for values that remain the same (I.e. If you know the value didn't change, use  = ), or values that are different (use 'not equal', symbol  != ).    Note 2 : There's unfortunately no guarantee from game to game on how the developers have stored their data (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, binary-coded decimals, negative/inverted, i.e. using 0xff/0xffff to represent 'set', or plain randomly), but eventually you should come across some good address. Note if you are struggling to find good values, post  RetroAchievements.org Development Help forum , or  RetroAchievements Discord server . There are plenty of people who will be very happy to help!!    Tip : if you'd like to experiment with memory, try entering new values directly into the RAM viewer. This can have devastating effects on the game, or it might do exactly what you expect, (or nothing at all!) It can be useful though, to see if you can enter a value and get the result you expect. Use with caution!    When you've found an address you're happy with, you can write a short note for what it is and hit  Save Note , this will store it on database, and will be automatically restored next time you load up the memory viewer for this game, wherever you are! Note that after clicking 'Save Note', the note will be automatically stored on the database, and shared so all developers will share access to these memory notes. They will all be downloaded afresh when you load a ROM. If you try to overwrite a note, it will check with you first before submitting.  You can find more useful  Memory Digging Tips here .",

This tool can be found on \"RetroAchievements\" tab on any emulator integrated with RA.\n\n\nSee also\n: \nMemory Digging Tips\n.\n\n\nMemory Inspector Dialog\nlink\n\n\n\n\n1. Reset to\nlink\n\n\nClick on one of these buttons to start a new test. For most things 8-bit test would be appropriate. \n\n\n2. Filter Values\nlink\n\n\nUsually filter for either \n=\n (equals to) last known value or \n!=\n (different than) last known value. If you know the exact value you expect something to be, you can use \nGiven Value\n, or if you're convinced that a value should have increased, you could try \n>\n (greater than) or \n<\n (less than).\n\n\n3. Filter!\nlink\n\n\nWith every press of this button, you are filtering out values that do not match in memory between the last test and now.\n\n\n4. Results window\nlink\n\n\n\n\nAfter filtering you'll see in the results window exactly what happened, how many values you've got and how many are left. Some points to note:\n\n\n\n\nSearch results show live value changes, so you can more easily identify usable addresses. \n\n\nSearch results are highlighted depending on their criteria. For addresses that don't fit the search filter, they will be highlighted in red. This can be disabled on the \nHighlights\n checkbox, if preferred.\n\n\nYou can also manually exclude any selected addresses from the search. Use Ctrl or Shift to multi-select.\n\n\nResults History\n: You can move backwards (\n<<\n) or forwards (\n>>\n) through your previous filtered searches. Keep in mind if you start a new search (such as \nNew 8-bit Test\n), your history will be cleared.\n\n\n\n\n5. Watching\nlink\n\n\nAny properly formed value in this area will be watched in the \nMemory Viewer\n and bound to the \ncode notes\n on the right.  You can highlight and then arrow up and down here to quickly cycle through noted addresses.  The addresses must be \n0x\n (that's zero, then letter x), followed by hexadecimal digits.\n\n\n6. Memory Viewer\nlink\n\n\nAny watched variable and the variables around it will be shown in this window. You can manually arrow up and down in the viewer to advance the address pane or expand the viewer field by dragging the window vertically to view more addresses at once.  Additional info can be found below, in the \nReading data in the Memory Viewer\n section. \n\n\n7. Code Notes\nlink\n\n\nOnce you've found a memory address you want to make a note of, ensure the value is entered into the 'Watching' dropdown box. Next you can write a short description in the textbox next to it, and click \nSave Note\n. This will send the memory address and your description to the database, so it can be shared with all developers who work on this game.\n\n\nClick the dropdown arrow to view what memory addresses have been found so far, and you will be shown the description in the box next to it, to tell you what this memory address is for.\n\n\nTry and keep your descriptions simple and clear, so they can be easily understood. To rename a note, select it in the drop-down menu, update the description, and click \nSave Note\n. A dialog will prompt you to overwrite the existing note - check that it is a good change, and click OK.\n\n\nIf you wish to remove a note, select it in the dropdown menu, and click \nRemove\n.\n\n\n8. Memory Bookmarks\nlink\n\n\nWhen you click on the \nOpen Memory Bookmarker\n button you'll see this dialog:\n\n\n\n\nWith this, you can view multiple designated addresses at once instead of having to shuffle around in the Inspector.\n\n\nThe bookmarks can be renamed by double-clicking their description. If you double-click on the address, you can move straight to that point in the Mem Inspector.\n\n\nBookmarked addresses will show in the Memory Inspector as green. From here you can also Freeze any bookmarks.\n\n\nThis is helpful for things like health or consumables. Frozen values can be manipulated directly from the inspector. Keep in mind, freezing occurs \n1 frame after gameplay.\n This means even when frozen, the value will change for atleast one frame before returning to the frozen value. These will always be displayed as yellow.\n\n\nReading data in the Memory Viewer\nlink\n\n\nDecimal, Binary and Hexadecimal notations\nlink\n\n\nTo work well with the Memory Viewer, it's important to understand at least the basics of binary and hexadecimal numeral notations. Here are good sources of information about this matter without going into extreme details:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number\n\n\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_numeral_system\n\n\n\n\nThe digits used in \nbinary system\n are \n0\n and \n1\n. A \nbinary digit\n is also known as \nbit\n. Eight bits is also known as one \nbyte\n.\n\n\nThe digits used in \nhexadecimal system\n are \n0\n, \n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n, \nA\n, \nB\n, \nC\n, \nD\n, \nE\n and \nF\n. The \nhexadecimal notation\n is also known as \nhex\n.\n\n\nThe main reasons for the existence of these 2 notations, besides the traditional decimal notation, are:\n\n\n\n\nDecimal notation is what humans understand.\n\n\nBinary notation is what computers \"understand\".\n\n\nHexadecimal notation can be seen as a middle ground between binary and decimal. Because a single hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits, then a shorter and more understandable notation for humans to work in a way that the computer \"understands\".\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the different notations for equivalent values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecimal\n\n\nHexadecimal\n\n\nBinary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0x0\n\n\n0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0x1\n\n\n0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0x2\n\n\n0010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0x3\n\n\n0011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0x4\n\n\n0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0x5\n\n\n0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n0x6\n\n\n0110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n0x7\n\n\n0111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n0x8\n\n\n1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n0x9\n\n\n1001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0xA\n\n\n1010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n0xB\n\n\n1011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n0xC\n\n\n1100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n0xD\n\n\n1101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n0xE\n\n\n1110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n0xF\n\n\n1111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore facts about the different number notations:\n\n\n\n\nTo indicate a value is written in hexadecimal, the prefix \n0x\n is used: \n0x10 = 16\n, \n10 = 10\n.\n\n\nTwo hex digits represent 8 bits and can range from \n0\n to \n255\n. \n\n\nFour hex digits represent 16 bits and can range \n0\n to \n65535\n.\n\n\nEight hex digits represent 32 bits and can range from \n0\nto \n4294967295\n.\n\n\n\n\nMemory Viewer modes\nlink\n\n\nThe bottom part of the Memory Inspector is what we call the Memory Viewer:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see data in Memory Viewer using 8, 16 or 32-bit modes.\n\n\n8-bit mode\nlink\n\n\nBy default, the Memory Viewer shows data in 8-bit mode. This displays each byte of memory as a separate two-character hexadecimal value. And each byte has its own address.\n\n\nSixteen bytes are shown per line. The address of a byte can be determined by adding the row index (displayed to the left of the viewer) to the column index (displayed above the viewer). Using the \nimage above\n as an example, the cursor is at \n0x002a7\n (\n0x002a0\n + \n7\n).\n\n\n16/32-bit mode\nlink\n\n\nBefore we talk about 16-bit mode and 32-bit mode, it's important to know about endianness:\n\n\n\n\nEndianness\nlink\n\n\nEndianness describes the order in which a sequence of bytes are stored in computer systems memory. The two most common types are: \nBig-Endian\n (also known as BE) and \nLittle-Endian\n (also known as LE).\n\n\nIn the \nBig-Endian\n order the \"big end\" of the number (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first (placed at the lowest address). In the image below you see the number \n0x12345678\n stored at the address \n0x100\n in the big-endian order. Notice that the most significant byte \n0x12\n is at the address \n0x100\n:\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nLittle-Endian\n order the \"little end\" of the number (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first. In the image below you see the number \n0x12345678\n stored at the address \n0x100\n in the little-endian order. Notice that the least significant byte \n0x78\n is at the address \n0x100\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues that need more then 8-bits (in other words: larger than 255) have to be stored in multiple bytes. However, the emulated systems we use store multi-byte values in little-endian order.\n\n\nIn the \nimage of the Memory Viewer above\n you can see that at address \n0x0002c0\n we have the hex value \nce\n and in \n0x0002c1\n the value is \n39\n. When you switch the viewer to 16-bit mode, the \nce\n and \n39\n values are grouped at \n0x0002c0\n and get displayed as \n39ce\n. This happens because it automatically groups every two bytes and displays them as 16-bit hex values.\n\n\nNOTE\n: While 16-bit values are usually aligned to even addresses, that's not always the case. There's actually a non-displayed 16-bit value at \n0x0002c1\n. Since the value at \n0x0002c1\n is \n39\n and the value at \n0x0002c2\n is \n29\n, the 16-bit value at \n0x0002c1\n address is \n0x2939\n.\n\n\nSimilarly, in 32-bit mode, the four bytes from \n0x0002c0\n to \n0x0002c3\n are displayed as a single 32-bit value \n0x252939ce\n at address \n0x0002c0\n, but there are also 32-bit values at \n0x0002c1\n, \n0x0002c2\n, and \n0x0002c3\n.\n\n\nWorking with sizes smaller than 8-bit\nlink\n\n\nIn addition to the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit sizes described above, there are additional sizes that can be used when writing achievements (in the Achievement Editor).\n\n\nSingle bits\nlink\n\n\nIn the memory viewer when an 8-bit address is selected you will see something like the image below (in the image: a byte with the value \n6f\n is selected; the bits are highlighted with an orange circle):\n\n\n\n\nIt is very common in games to store important information as a single bit. As a bit can only have two possible values (\n1\n or \n0\n), sometimes it's used to mean \"yes\" or \"no\", \"on\" or \"off\", \"have item\" or \"no item\", etc. Some games, specially those with limited memory space, use bit switches a lot.\n\n\nImportant:\n You can refer to each one of those bits individually in the Achievement Editor.\n\n\nCommon meaning of bit switches in a game memory:\n\n\n\n\nhave an item\n\n\nbutton pressed (very common)\n\n\narea explored\n\n\nin game trigger activated\n\n\ncheat activated\n\n\nin demo mode\n\n\n\n\nIn the memory viewer you can only input hex values, then it's important to know equivalence of values between hex and binary notations. You can see the table in the \"\nDecimal, Binary and Hexadecimal notations\n\" section, but the usual is to use a calculator (the default calculator on MS Windows on the programmer view can do the job).\n\n\nUpper4 and Lower4\nlink\n\n\nUpper4\n is the upper four bits of a byte (bit: 7, 6, 5, 4), displayed as a single hexadecimal character. \nLower4\n is the lower four bits of a byte (bit: 3, 2, 1, 0), displayed as a single hexadecimal character.\n\n\nLooking at the \nmemory size diagram\n below, a byte at address \n0x00a274\n is selected (value \n0x23\n). The first character, \n2\n is the Upper4 value. The second character \n3\n is the Lower4 value.\n\n\nOccasionally you will only be interested working with a single hexadecimal digit. Using the \nmemory size diagram\n as an example, an achievement condition where \nUpper4 0x00a274 = 0x2\n would be true. A condition where \nLower4 0x00a274 = 0x3\n would be true.\n\n\nMemory Sizes diagram\nlink\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-03-14 00:37] Keltron3030:\n Updated Memory Inspector Overview (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-03-14 00:35] Keltron3030:\n Added some additional info to memory viewer features as requested by Jr developer.\n\n\n[2019-02-14 21:56] meleu:\n bitfields image\n\n\n[2019-02-14 21:45] meleu:\n test2\n\n\n[2019-02-14 21:44] meleu:\n test\n\n\n[2019-02-12 08:50] meleu:\n removed \"bit switch\" title, as unnecessary\n\n\n[2019-02-12 08:48] meleu:\n reducing verbosity in \"single bits\"\n\n\n[2019-02-12 08:14] meleu:\n fix broken links\n\n\n[2019-02-12 08:14] meleu:\n exchange \"single bits\" and \"Upper4/Lower4\" sections (it's easier to understand Upper4/Lower4 once you know about bits)\n\n\n[2019-02-12 08:08] meleu:\n reducing verbosity in \"Upper4/Lower4\"",

Here are good sources of information about this matter without going into extreme details:   https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number  https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_numeral_system   The digits used in  binary system  are  0  and  1 . A  binary digit  is also known as  bit . Eight bits is also known as one  byte .  The digits used in  hexadecimal system  are  0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  A ,  B ,  C ,  D ,  E  and  F . The  hexadecimal notation  is also known as  hex .  The main reasons for the existence of these 2 notations, besides the traditional decimal notation, are:   Decimal notation is what humans understand.  Binary notation is what computers \"understand\".  Hexadecimal notation can be seen as a middle ground between binary and decimal. Because a single hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits, then a shorter and more understandable notation for humans to work in a way that the computer \"understands\".   The table below shows the different notations for equivalent values.     Decimal  Hexadecimal  Binary      0  0x0  0000    1  0x1  0001    2  0x2  0010    3  0x3  0011    4  0x4  0100    5  0x5  0101    6  0x6  0110    7  0x7  0111    8  0x8  1000    9  0x9  1001    10  0xA  1010    11  0xB  1011    12  0xC  1100    13  0xD  1101    14  0xE  1110    15  0xF  1111     More facts about the different number notations:   To indicate a value is written in hexadecimal, the prefix  0x  is used:  0x10 = 16 ,  10 = 10 .  Two hex digits represent 8 bits and can range from  0  to  255 .   Four hex digits represent 16 bits and can range  0  to  65535 .  Eight hex digits represent 32 bits and can range from  0 to  4294967295 .",

The two most common types are:  Big-Endian  (also known as BE) and  Little-Endian  (also known as LE).  In the  Big-Endian  order the \"big end\" of the number (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first (placed at the lowest address). In the image below you see the number  0x12345678  stored at the address  0x100  in the big-endian order. Notice that the most significant byte  0x12  is at the address  0x100 :   In the  Little-Endian  order the \"little end\" of the number (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first. In the image below you see the number  0x12345678  stored at the address  0x100  in the little-endian order. Notice that the least significant byte  0x78  is at the address  0x100 :    Values that need more then 8-bits (in other words: larger than 255) have to be stored in multiple bytes. However, the emulated systems we use store multi-byte values in little-endian order.  In the  image of the Memory Viewer above  you can see that at address  0x0002c0  we have the hex value  ce  and in  0x0002c1  the value is  39 . When you switch the viewer to 16-bit mode, the  ce  and  39  values are grouped at  0x0002c0  and get displayed as  39ce . This happens because it automatically groups every two bytes and displays them as 16-bit hex values.  NOTE : While 16-bit values are usually aligned to even addresses, that's not always the case. There's actually a non-displayed 16-bit value at  0x0002c1 . Since the value at  0x0002c1  is  39  and the value at  0x0002c2  is  29 , the 16-bit value at  0x0002c1  address is  0x2939 .  Similarly, in 32-bit mode, the four bytes from  0x0002c0  to  0x0002c3  are displayed as a single 32-bit value  0x252939ce  at address  0x0002c0 , but there are also 32-bit values at  0x0002c1 ,  0x0002c2 , and  0x0002c3 .",

As a bit can only have two possible values ( 1  or  0 ), sometimes it's used to mean \"yes\" or \"no\", \"on\" or \"off\", \"have item\" or \"no item\", etc. Some games, specially those with limited memory space, use bit switches a lot.

It works similar to \nAddSource\n, but modifies the address, not the resulting value. Additionally, it affects addresses on both sides of the condition.\n\n\nAddAddress\n only affects the next condition. If multiple \nAddAddress\n lines are chained together, each lookup in the chain will be altered; the values won't all be added to the final lookup.\n\n\n\n\nThe 32-bit value at 0x0112F8 is a pointer to the data for the first character in the party. When the party order changes, the pointer will point at a different block of memory, but data within the block will have the same structure.\n\n\n\n\nThe value is an address in the actual system representation and differs from the addresses provided by the memory inspector. However, you can rely on the fact that the memory inspector represents the same memory, so while the actual address may differ, the sequence of bytes does not.\n\n\n\n\nTo translate the real pointer to a memory inspector address, we compare the two values. For example:\n\n\n\n\nThe 32-bit value at 0x0112F8 is 0x800110B8.\n\n\nThe memory we're interested in is at 0x011114 in the memory inspector.\n\n\nUsing a 24-bit read instead of a 32-bit read gives us 0x0110B8\n\n\n0x011114 - 0x0110B8 = 0x00005C, so that becomes the \"base address\" in the second condition.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Pointers\nlink\n\n\nAddAddress\n is how RAIntegration handles pointers. There are four major types of pointer support:\n\n\nDirect Pointer\n: The pointer contains another address that is referenced without modification. These are most commonly used for string pointers. To use a direct pointer, the base address to which the pointer is added would be 0.\n\n\nIndirect Pointer\n: The pointer contains another address that indicates the start of some block of data. The data of interest is a fixed number of bytes into the block of data. These are commonly used for attributes of a character/object.\n\n\nFor both Direct and Indirect Pointers, the \nAddAddress\n line should reference the pointer, and the address in the following line should be the offset into the block of data for the information relevant to the condition. While you would typically use 0 for a Direct Pointers, the following line would also contain any value necessary to convert between a real address and a memory inspector address.\n\n\nThe example above is an Indirect Pointer, where the data is 0x5C bytes into a block of data. The conversion from a real address to a memory inspector address is handled by using a 24-bit read instead of a 32-bit read.\n\n\nArray Index\n: The pointer contains an offset to apply to a fixed pointer.\n\n\nScaled Array Index\n: The pointer contains an offset to apply to a fixed pointer after it has been scaled.\n\n\nFor Array Indices, the \nAddAddress\n line should reference the offset to apply, and the following line should contain the address of the first element of the array (index 0). For example:\n\n\nAddAddress 16-bit Mem 0x1234\n           8-bit  Mem 0x4567\n\n\n\n\nWould read a 16-bit number from 0x1234 and read the single byte that is that many bytes after 0x4567.\n\n\nNOTE: \nScaling an array index is not currently supported\n. The intent is that the first line would become \nAddAddress 16-bit Mem 0x1234 * 4\n to indicate that each time 0x1234 is incremented by 1, the offset past 0x4567 would be incremented by 4. Attempting to call \nAddAddress\n four times to simulate the multiplication won't work because each line of the chain is a separate lookup.\n\n\nChaining Pointers\nlink\n\n\nAddAddress\n can be chained to perform multi-step lookups, but only one step at a time. As such, you can reference data pointed at by a pointer that's pointed at by another pointer, but you can't reference data in an array that's pointed at by another pointer unless either the array or the array index is at a fixed address.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-11-17 22:18] meleu:\n fix markdown formats\n\n\n[2019-11-16 07:53] Jamiras:\n Updated AddAddress Flag (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-11-14 20:25] Jamiras:\n Created AddAddress Flag (markdown)",

The example above is an Indirect Pointer, where the data is 0x5C bytes into a block of data. The conversion from a real address to a memory inspector address is handled by using a 24-bit read instead of a 32-bit read.  Array Index : The pointer contains an offset to apply to a fixed pointer.  Scaled Array Index : The pointer contains an offset to apply to a fixed pointer after it has been scaled.  For Array Indices, the  AddAddress  line should reference the offset to apply, and the following line should contain the address of the first element of the array (index 0). For example:  AddAddress 16-bit Mem 0x1234\n           8-bit  Mem 0x4567  Would read a 16-bit number from 0x1234 and read the single byte that is that many bytes after 0x4567.  NOTE:  Scaling an array index is not currently supported . The intent is that the first line would become  AddAddress 16-bit Mem 0x1234 * 4  to indicate that each time 0x1234 is incremented by 1, the offset past 0x4567 would be incremented by 4. Attempting to call  AddAddress  four times to simulate the multiplication won't work because each line of the chain is a separate lookup.",

            "text": "In this example you'll see how to circumvent the problem of a counter incrementing twice in the same frame by combining \nSubSource\n and \nAddHits\n.\n\n\nIn the Game Boy Advance library there's a Christmas platformer game called \nSanta Claus Jr. Advance\n. There are some achievements for collecting all candy canes in each one of the bonus stages.\n\n\nSuch achievements were supposed to be quite simple, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nSpecial?\n\n\nMemory\n\n\nCmp\n\n\nType\n\n\nMem/Val\n\n\nHits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n0xCANDIES\n\n\n!=\n\n\nDelta\n\n\n0xCANDIES\n\n\n(N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nResetIf\n\n\n0xSTAGE\n\n\n!=\n\n\nValue\n\n\n0xBONUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis translates into \"check if the candy canes counter changed \nN\n times in the bonus stage\".\n\n\nNote\n: we're using \n0xCANDIES != Delta 0xCANDIES\n (using \n!=\n, and not \n>\n) cause when the player has 99 candies and collect one more, the counter goes to zero.\n\n\nHowever, there is an aspect in this game (and many others) where if the player collect 2 candy canes simultaneously the counter is increased by 2 in the same frame. When it happens the hit counter is increased by one while the candy counter is increased by two. This, obviously, ruins the logic used above.\n\n\nIn order to circumvent this issue we have to use that technique of \nusing \nSubSource\n to count specific increments\n combined with the \nAddHits\n flag\n.\n\n\nLet's take a look at the achievement logic and then we'll see the explanation:\n\n\nAddresses\n\n\n\n\n0x80dc\n: Candy Canes counter.\n\n\n0x809c\n: Stage ID.\n\n\n\n\nSo now the structure of the achievement is going to be like this:\n\n\n\n\nConditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether with condition 2, is a trick used to check if \n0xCANDIES - Delta 0xCANDIES = 2\n. In other words, the candy counter was incremented by two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsed together with condition 1 (as explained above) and 3. As explained in \nits respective page\n, when the \nAddHits\n condition is true, the hit counter in the next condition is incremented. Therefore, in our example here, when condition 2 is true, the hitcounter in condition 3 is incremented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount when the candy counter changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset the counter if not in the Bonus stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll these conditions could be translated as \"while in the bonus stage, trigger the achievement if the candy counter changes 99 times, and if the candy counter is incremented by 2 in the same frame, count an extra change in the candy counter.\"\n\n\nSo, now it is 100% solved, right? Well, actually, almost. There is still a very minor exception. Remember it was said before that \n!=\n was being used instead of \n>\n because \nwhen the player has 99 candies and collect one more, the counter goes to zero\n?\n\n\nThis means that, if we get two canes in the same frame (which is already rare), there's a very small possibility that this change will be from \n98 -> 00\n or from \n99 -> 01\n. In these only two cases our code won't work, because \n00 - 98\n is not 2, it is \n-98\n. Same thing for \n01 - 99\n, it is not 2, it is also \n-98\n.\n\n\nDespite being a very unlikely possibility, we should treat this case too. So we're gonna add two more requirements to the code, and it will end up looking like this:\n\n\n\n\nIt is the same as before, with the only changes being lines 3 and 4, which represents an extra \nSubSource + Add Hits\n to check if \n0xCANDIES - Delta 0xCANDIES = -98\n, only to take care of this very minor exception just mentioned.\n\n\nAnd now it is solved!\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-04-16 12:17] Thoooreau:\n treating 98 -> 00 and 99 -> 01 exception\n\n\n[2019-03-16 22:33] meleu:\n trimming down\n\n\n[2019-02-28 21:06] Thoooreau:\n text\n\n\n[2019-02-24 12:51] meleu:\n grammar\n\n\n[2019-02-19 19:31] meleu:\n not every bonus have 99 candy canes\n\n\n[2019-02-18 17:43] meleu:\n cosmetic\n\n\n[2019-02-18 17:43] meleu:\n a little bit of more explanation\n\n\n[2019-02-17 23:33] meleu:\n trimmed down version\n\n\n[2019-02-17 21:20] Thoooreau:\n minor stuff\n\n\n[2019-02-17 21:18] Thoooreau:\n minor stuff",

Looking at larger chunks of memory will complicate things, but it will make a seasoned developer's job easier. If you're just starting out and unaware of terms like \nendianess\n and \nbit ordering\n (or when the eyes are tired), its best to make your observations in 8-bit view. Its just easier!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncheck \"Show Decimal Values\"\n in the Achievement Editor so you can enter the hex values you see in the Memory Viewer. Its better than using a programmers calculator!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find an address, also search the same region surrounding it and you could find many more useful addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can input values in the memory viewer to see if it affects the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if something is visibly decreasing in-game, like health, memory can behave differently. It's possible for it to be increasing, so since it's uncommon for you to know for sure, prefer the \n!=\n and \n=\n filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you absolutely cannot reduce the results of a filter, you can try guessing some values or at least how the value is acting (\n>\n or \n<\n). For example, no health is usually \n0\n, Stage 1 is usually value \n0\n, Stage 2 is usually value \n1\n depending on the type of game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16/32 bit view\n: remember that when working with 16 or 32 bit address the address to the right comes first. Example: if in 8bit it looks like \nAB CD WX YZ\n, in 16 bit it becomes \nCDAB YZWX\n. This is called \"\nbig endian byte ordering\n\". You can safely ignore the geek-speak by just remembering things are stored \nbackwards\n in 16 bit view and above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBit fields\n: Use single bits for things that only change a single bit. In the Memory Inspector, when an address is selected, there will be \nBits: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n above the addresses. And below those numbers will be either \n0\n or \n1\n, like \n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1\n in the image below. If \nbit5\n has \n1\n under it, then \nbit3=1\n for that address. Single bit usage is very common for game items/events/unlocks/etc. This may be confusing, but it's very important to understand. Some games with limited memory space use bit fields a lot! Its an important technique to learn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAchievement Creation Tips\nlink\n\n\nSee also: \nUnwelcome Concepts\n and \nAchievement Design\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever\n Avoid using only one condition as much as you can\n. When using only one condition the achievement will most likely pop at the wrong time.  This is the \nmost common error by a developer\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the game has a \ndemo mode\n (AI plays the game after you wait a while on the title screen), make sure to find the address for it and add a condition so your achievements don't trigger in demo mode. You'll probably need to know how to use \nPauseIf\n and \nResetIf\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf\n cheat codes\n: If the game has a cheat code to increase lives, select stages, etc. Make sure to find the addresses for it and add some kind of protection in your achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanna create an achievement for \ncollecting a specific and unique item\n in the game, add some conditions to make sure the player got the item where it is supposed to be obtained, \nlike in this template here\n. Otherwise the achievement may trigger by using password, loading a save game, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOR conditions\n: if you need OR conditions, you'll need \nAlt groups\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid Achievement spam\n. If a game has 100 levels, do not make an achievement for each level. Do every 25 or so. Consider the time segment a casual player would unlock these progressive Achievements in. If generally you could unlock all in a progressive set of Achievements of this nature in under half an hour as a casual player, that's filler design, and not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Creative and Fun\n: Get as creative as possible with achievements. \"Beat X without using/doing Y\", \"Beat X in 5 seconds\", \"3 heart run\". Be sure casual players can still get these with their best effort. It isn't fun if its way too difficult for a casual player!  (See:  \nBonus Set Tips\n below for the real challenges!). There is a whole page about \nAchievement Design\n that can give good advices on how to think about good achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlitchless, please!\n: Do not make achievements requiring glitches. Glitches, in most cases, corrupt and destabilize game memory and RAM. They break the rest of the set to include. It is however, wise to code block walls stopping players from using them to get easy mastery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid relying on text and graphics\n: Most of the time, an achievement that requires triggering a special event can be tied to an event flag (usually a single bit or byte), or to an item received by the player. It is better practice to use these values than to check the ID of text being displayed in a text box, or, even worse, video RAM (memory tied to the actual graphics displaying on the screen) as they are often less stable. Especially between different versions of a single game, and they are more difficult to debug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love Art\n:  Pretty badges are rewarding badges! It should visually represent the achievement itself, or hint at the location in the game for secrets.  Matching to the game's art style works well.  Google Image searches for \"Sprite Sheets\" is an useful tip to include some game art. If you're a good graphics artist, updating badges is your time to shine! More info can be found at the \nBadge and Icon Creation page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Consideration\n: For games with text-triggered achievements (especially RPGs) it's recommend to find an event flag instead of hooking onto text or text ID. Text presentation varies between regional versions making multi-region support difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming Convention Tips\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Symbols\n: Do not use accented/special characters like the \n\u00e9\n in Pokemon, as they currently break a few things (like feed). They are also not visible in search without the special character. Same for UTF-8 Universal Emoji codes. \nAllowed exception\n: \nRich Presence Scripts\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMind your English\n: avoid grammar mistakes. As RetroAchievements is an international community, using English for Code Notes is a good practice, as another developer can use your notes in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTricks\nlink\n\n\nFinding the address for Demo Mode\nlink\n\n\nAn usual trick to start filtering addresses to find the Demo Mode is to let the demo begin and then start to filter \n=\n \"Last Known Value\" and press \"Filter\" many times, stopping right before the demo ends (be careful to not filter after the demo ends).\n\n\nNow start the game normally and when you're able to control the character change the filter to \n!=\n and then filter \none single time\n. The filtered addresses are the ones that has changed since the demo mode.\n\n\nNow change the filtering back to \n=\n and then start a sequence of play-and-filter. Which means play a bit, move around then scenario, defeat some enemies, and then filter.\n\n\nPro tip\n: It is very very very useful to have savestates in different levels of the game, so you can do the play-and-filter in different scenarios and make the filtering more effective.\n\n\nAfter getting a few addresses as result, quite often the demo value will be \n1\n (sometimes it's also \nff\n). If you find a potential address edit it to \n0\n and check if you become able to control the character. If yes, BINGO!, that's the address you're looking for.\n\n\nAddress Watcher\nlink\n\n\nHere's an easy trick using a dummy achievement to watch an address for any changes, which is something you'll quite often want to know.\n\n\n\n\nConditions Explained\n  \n\n\n\n\nValue 1 = Value 0\n; This is to prevent the achievement from ever being true, as the value 0 never equals 1.\n\n\nValue 1 = Value 1\n; For this trick to work the achievement needs hits to reset. When 1 = 1 hits will be added to this condition.\n\n\n\n\nResetIf Mem 0x10 != Delta 0x10\n; This is the address you want to watch. Any time there is a change the achievement will reset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast of all make sure that \nPause on Reset\n and \nActive\n are both checked. Now you will get a pop-up and emulation will pause each time this address changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-08-13 19:42] Kvon:\n Tips and Tricks: Text hooks tip added\n\n\n[2019-02-07 14:57] meleu:\n decrease verbosity; add trick fo find demo mode; group tips and tricks more reasonably\n\n\n[2019-01-17 11:19] meleu:\n removed the \"Limitations\" topic\n\n\n[2019-01-17 11:17] meleu:\n subnests on bullet points need 4 spaces\n\n\n[2019-01-15 19:15] Jamiras:\n Update reset behavior for 0.75 toolkit\n\n\n[2019-01-13 16:20] Rapha\u00ebl Zumer:\n Add \"Avoid relying on text and graphics\" tip\n\n\n[2019-01-13 15:41] Rapha\u00ebl Zumer:\n Fix typos and reword a memory digging tip\n\n\n[2019-01-12 21:59] Kvon:\n Added some demo finding tips and a trick for watching addresses\n\n\n[2018-09-09 20:52] Kvon:\n moved rom selection onto it's own page\n\n\n[2018-09-01 12:48] Jamiras:\n note about reset processing in 0.73",

            "text": "See also:  Memory Inspector Overview .    Start with 8-bit view in the Memory Viewer. Looking at larger chunks of memory will complicate things, but it will make a seasoned developer's job easier. If you're just starting out and unaware of terms like  endianess  and  bit ordering  (or when the eyes are tired), its best to make your observations in 8-bit view. Its just easier!    Uncheck \"Show Decimal Values\"  in the Achievement Editor so you can enter the hex values you see in the Memory Viewer. Its better than using a programmers calculator!    If you find an address, also search the same region surrounding it and you could find many more useful addresses.    You can input values in the memory viewer to see if it affects the game.    Even if something is visibly decreasing in-game, like health, memory can behave differently. It's possible for it to be increasing, so since it's uncommon for you to know for sure, prefer the  !=  and  =  filters.    If you absolutely cannot reduce the results of a filter, you can try guessing some values or at least how the value is acting ( >  or  < ). For example, no health is usually  0 , Stage 1 is usually value  0 , Stage 2 is usually value  1  depending on the type of game.    16/32 bit view : remember that when working with 16 or 32 bit address the address to the right comes first. Example: if in 8bit it looks like  AB CD WX YZ , in 16 bit it becomes  CDAB YZWX . This is called \" big endian byte ordering \". You can safely ignore the geek-speak by just remembering things are stored  backwards  in 16 bit view and above.    Bit fields : Use single bits for things that only change a single bit. In the Memory Inspector, when an address is selected, there will be  Bits: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  above the addresses. And below those numbers will be either  0  or  1 , like  0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1  in the image below. If  bit5  has  1  under it, then  bit3=1  for that address. Single bit usage is very common for game items/events/unlocks/etc. This may be confusing, but it's very important to understand. Some games with limited memory space use bit fields a lot! Its an important technique to learn.",

What you're going to see here are not rules, just suggestions.\n\n\nNote\n: be aware of \nDevelopers Code of Conduct\n\n\nDifficulty Scale:\nlink\n\n\n\n\nFreebie\n\n\nEasy\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMed-hard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nVery-Hard\n\n\nSuper-Hard\n\n\n\n\nMore details on these \nat the bottom\n.\n\n\nIn general there should be an steady sloping balance of difficulty. One should think of the overall difficulty of a set while building it. One should not make sets excessively difficult.\n\n\nA good set balance on a 50 cheeves in an average set would have roughly: 4 freebies, 6 easy cheeves, 10 medium, 10 med-hard, 14 hard, and 6 very-hard, 0 kaizo.\n\n\nA well balanced difficulty distribution has rewards for every type of player. It gives each skill level something to accomplish until mastery.\n\n\nAchievements should not just be a check-mark of completing a game\n, (too easy) but create fun new memories for the game (diversity of challenges).\n\n\nIt leaves space for freebies that are featuring curious or fun elements of the game. It expects enough difficulty that once you've mastered the set you are a master of the game. But it doesn't ask too much from the player either.\n\n\nIt also shouldn't ask the player to be doing seemingly endless repetitive grinding to make a set seem harder. Doing the same task over and over isn't hard, it's typically dull. It should almost always avoid making marathon types with a hill at the end (ones that require long setup times with low or repetitive difficulty and then a spike of high difficulty at the end. Don't do it!).\n\n\nSets should be mastereable by a skilled player who gives a dedicated effort.\n\n\nSets should reflect the content of the game. Grinding cheeves in games that require grinding are reasonable, where in other places they would often be inappropriate.\n\n\nSets should also break out of just what is expected from a game, pushing the player to need to find new solutions for problems a veteran player never considered.\n\n\nSet Quantity:\nlink\n\n\nSet quantity should not have such hard rules. Quality is the key factor.\n\n\nThe set quantity strongly depends on how much fun and challenges the game can give. That's why the set developer must know the game very well.\n\n\nSet Variety:\nlink\n\n\nKeep it fun, give it variety, challenge the player, give the player new things to do.\n\n\nSome achievements can give much fun to the player when they are like a meta-game. Where the player is required to rethink the game entirely.\n\n\nSome notable examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabulous ComboFabulous Combo (15)\n - it turns the game into a puzzle game, completing this can be really satifying\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwordless Adventurer (20)\n - with no sword you are forced to rethink the entire game. You can discover how useful all the subweapons are. Very fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere Are No Bullets in the Energy Zone (10)\n - pacifist challenges, when possible force a lot more agility from the player and break old habits. Very fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of Difficulty\nlink\n\n\n0 - freebie\nlink\n\n\nTakes almost no effort for basically all players to achieve this OR the player gets it without any conscious effort. The player gets these on accident and they pop up on the screen. Sometimes the player will have no idea why they earned them. Some freebies are good some are bad.\n\n\nExamples:\n Starting the game, picking a character, collecting an easily accessible item, killing your first enemy. Stumbling on a cheeve that took no forethought but highlights elements of the game.\n\n\n1 - Easy\nlink\n\n\nMost players could get these on their first attempt, Some on their second or third attempt. Rarely players can mess it up.\n\n\nExamples:\n Progress on easy stages, getting 100 coins, collecting a feather, collecting 20 rings. Getting the first upgrade, getting to a well known secret stage. Fighting a simple boss: most bosses in Super Mario World, completing early stages in Sonic.\n\n\n2 - Medium\nlink\n\n\nMany players could get this on their first attempt. Many could after a few attempts. Some will need to practice. Very few will struggle with them.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting all the colored switches in Super Mario World, collecting all of the items in a Castlevania stage, getting a bonus item in a more hidden area, like moons in SMW. Beating Contra with the Konami code.\n\n\n3 - Medium-Hard\nlink\n\n\nA low amount of players could get this on their first attempt. Some after a few attempts and most will take some effort and practice to complete these. A few will find them very challenging, and give up.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting some of the chaos emeralds in Sonic 2. Beating Super Mario World.\n\n\n4 - Hard\nlink\n\n\nVery few player can get these on their first attempt, perhaps if they already know the game (not really a first attempt is it?) Most can complete these with a solid effort, many attempts and some practice, and some need to practice other games first.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting all of the Chaos emeralds in Sonic 1,2,3. Beating Contra without the Konami code.\n\n\n5 - Very Hard\nlink\n\n\nOnly the rarest of players can complete these on a first attempt. Most can complete it after many attempts, Many players will drop off here and won't be willing to complete the set unless they are completionists or fans of the game. Many are not able to complete this after very many attempts. Usually takes significant practice, high skills, experience, research, or guides to complete.\n\n\nExamples:\n Beating Contra in one life. Escaping Zebes (Super Metroid) in under two minutes. Beating many of the Megaman bosses without taking damage. Many damagless stages, depending on the game.\n\n\n6 - Super Hard\nlink\n\n\nMost players are not able to complete this after dozens of attempts. Many players will never be able to complete it as it could require beyond normal reaction speeds. The top-most skilled players still consider these blisteringly hard. It may take marathon efforts to restart.\n\n\nExamples:\n Completing a game without taking damage especially if the player has a lifebar, challenges that drastically restrict the player and require near frame perfect accuracy tor success. Beating contra twice in one life. Penniless plumber. Beating Megaman without taking damage.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2017-11-26 00:26] Kvon:\n Changed title from \"Achievement Difficulty Scale and Difficulty Balance\"",

            "text": "This is a guide on how to think about and design good achievements. Not the technical side but the conceptual.\n\n\nThis content is a summary of what was \noriginally written by RA user cirellio on a forum topic\n.\n\n\nProgression Based Achievements\nlink\n\n\nThere are 3 types of progression based achievements: simple progression, story-based progression, and progression/collection achievements.\n\n\nSimple Progression\nlink\n\n\nProgression-based achievements are usually simplest ones, especially if the game you are doing is nothing but linear stages. Or doesn't have much going on in the way of storylines. In this case, let's look at some GOOD and BAD examples of this:\n\n\n\n\nGood: Clear stage 1. \n\n\nBad: Reach stage 2. \n\n\n\n\nIt takes slightly more work to code an achievement where the player is required to clear the stage rather than simply reach the next one. But it is also much more satisfying for the player, and it is much more professional-looking. It is also \nless susceptible to problems with players loading save games or savestates for freebie achievements en masse\n. \n\n\n\n\nGood: Complete the game. \n\n\nBad: Start the game. \n\n\n\n\nWhile it is true progression-based achievements are often freebies, it is generally agreed upon here that an achievement to start the game is a bit too easy, and not at all memorable for the player. It's just a formality. The ending of the game, however, is often the most memorable part of a game for a player, and completing a game is definitely an achievement in itself. It's a good practice to make such achievement work like \"Beat last stage and beat the game\".\n\n\n\n\nGood: Cleared the ice theme stages, or Cleared the first five stages, or Cleared the first ten stages. \n\n\nBad: Complete Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (all separate achievements) \n\n\n\n\nOne of the worst things you can do is create achievement spam. Puzzle games are notorious for these kinds of problems, because the stages are short and often, there are one-hundred of them or more. As a result, the main page feed ends up with a lot of micro-updates, which spams other folks' achievements down and off the front page quickly. The way to come off as more professional in this matter is to space out the achievements a bit more, into groups of stages. For instance, if stages 1-10 are all fire themed, and stages 11-20 are all outer-space themed, you can create achievements around these themes. Be creative. \n\n\nStory Based Progression:\nlink\n\n\nThe most memorable moments in gaming history are often not related to item collection or sidequests, but to specific scenes relating to the story. \n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nFirst encounter with Pyramid Head in the Silent Hill series. \n\n\nFinding out the truth about Darth Revan in Knights of the Old Republic. \n\n\nFinding out what will happen in the future in Chrono Trigger. \n\n\nLaunching the Cow in Earthworm Jim. \n\n\nPretty much any character death. \n\n\n\n\nThe thing you have to be extra-careful with here is spoilers. If you catch a progression-based achievement that has a spoiler in it, by all means contact the dev about it. And devs, please be receptive when it comes to constructive criticism! Also, the number and even percentage of these will vary from game to game--The dependance lies heavily upon how story-driven the game is. \n\n\nProgression/Collection\nlink\n\n\nProgression/Collection is a common hybrid. Not only are you collecting an item, but it also launches into a memorable (and mandatory) scene. \n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nObtaining the Master Sword in Link to the Past, which lifts the curse in the Lost Woods. \n\n\nFinding the sword on the beach in Link's Awakening, which launches into the first scene where the wise owl speaks to you. \n\n\nPicking your starter Pokemon, which happens during a beginning scene, but is a 'rite of passage' for most gamers. \n\n\n\n\nAchievements in this hybrid category are often more satisfying because they are pulling double-duty. The player is not only obtaining an item, but watching a memorable scene and nabbing an achievement all at once. Quite the rush of endorphins! \n\n\nProgression Pros and Cons\nlink\n\n\nProgression Achievements are guaranteed to the player on a normal play-through. So why even have them? \n\n\nPros\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA player deserves points for playing through a game! They do! Remember, a lot of folks are playing through these games for the very first time, and most games are quite hard to beat. Why shouldn't we reward players for a good ol' normal play-through? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodic progression awards go a long way to encourage players to complete a game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome players are more casual and don't intend to do much more than beat games on this website. Not everyone feels the need to Master every game in Hardcore mode. Many are perfectly happy grabbing whatever convenient side-achievements they can during a normal play-through, and there's nothing wrong with that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome scenes are so memorable, they deserve achievements all their own! People who grew up with these games and love them look for these scenes in achievement lists, and it might just warm their heart when they see it was acknowledged. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgression Achievements help other people on the website gauge how far along a player is in a game, a bit like Rich Presence. We can drop a line to the player and say, \"Good luck!\" because we know the next section is pretty tricky. It encourages the community to interact. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder matters! Progression Achievements can tell us a lot about a play-through just by the order they occurred. If you pop that optional boss achievement and saved up a million dollars AFTER you've already done all the sidequests, that's much less impressive than if you manage to pull it off well before the mid-point of the game. In other words, Progression Achievements allow us to show-off a bit! We can show the world that we can beat that final boss before we've reached level 10, or that we can beat Expert mode on our first go before Easy and Normal. \nIt can even reveal if we've used glitches or cheats to skip certain portions of the game\n. So, as you can see, Progression Achievements have great SYNERGY with other kinds of achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese kinds of achievements are the easiest to code and are generally error-free. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToo many Progression Achievements can over-saturate a game with 'freebies', and that's a Very Bad Thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your entire game has nothing but these kinds of achievements, it's just another boring run through the game for players. Reach stage 2, Reach stage 3, Reach stage 4, Complete the Game. This is a great 'base' for you to start adding achievements from the other categories, but \ndon't leave your list at just Progression Achievements\n if you can help it. Otherwise you're just rewarding players full points for going through the motions like they've done a million times before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidequest/Optional Achievements\nlink\n\n\nVintage games, on their own, offer little-to-no incentive to beat a bonus mode, other than that it's something to do on a rainy day after you've beaten the game. Old games didn't have internet connectivity. And they had no social aspects other than 2-player mode, and maybe telling your friends at school that you beat something. But now, with RetroAchievements.org, we can display our vintage trophies (even though it requires us to redo what we've probably already done many years ago). These trophies are badges of honor. You can look at another member's Challenge Achievements and begin to understand how far they went, how skilled they are. Along with that comes respect from the other members. We socialize, we congratulate each other on a job well done. We feel like we belong, and we are in good company.\n\n\nSidequests\nlink\n\n\nThere are often things the player can do that are confined to the rules of the game, but aren't necessary to complete it. In other words, a challenge built into the game by the original game developers. Usually they are fun, or sometimes not so fun, but deserve an award because they require hard work and persistence to achieve. You have to walk a fine tightrope between if dedicated players are likely to do something, vs. if the goal is stupid. People will have differing views over this, so steel yourself.\n\n\nOften times, these types of achievements are even Easter Eggs or things the player never knew existed in their entire lives! Many players adore these types of achievements. I think it's because they learn something new about a game they grew up with, or feel like maybe they were the only ones who knew about a given secret and were excited to see it supported here. \nIt's important for us developers to REALLY know a game inside-and-out before creating an achievement set.\n\n\nExamples of Sidequests:\n\n\n\n\nDelivering tails to the Tail Collector in Final Fantasy IV. \n\n\nFinding the owner of the Insignificant Item in Earthbound. \n\n\nGiving the Jerky to the King in Guardia Castle. \n\n\nAnju sidequest in Majora's Mask. \n\n\nLearning about Wrex's past in Mass Effect. \n\n\nDiplomat/VIP escort missions in Flashback: The Quest for Identity. \n\n\nDiscovering a secret room. \n\n\n\n\nSidequests are most often found in RPGs, but especially these days, sidequests are finding their way into just about every genre. Keep your eyes peeled - Even the unsuspecting platformer may have a sidequest or three. The Kirby series, for instance, has many hidden rooms and areas. Often times, sidequests end up awarding an item, which falls under a hybrid: Sidequest/Collection.\n\n\nOptional Achievements\nlink\n\n\nExamples of Optional Achievements:\n\n\n\n\nOptional bosses. \n\n\nClearing a challenge dungeon (which is a hybrid of Sidequest). \n\n\nCompleting Expert Mode (which is a hybrid of Progression). \n\n\nCompleting a secret challenge level. \n\n\nGetting an exceptionally rare drop off of a monster. \n\n\nClearing the game with an optional character. \n\n\nGetting a high score. \n\n\nCompleting features only unlocked on a second playthrough. \n\n\nGame modes that are only unlocked on multiple playthroughs. \n\n\nOptional game endings. \n\n\nCodes you can enter during the title screen to make the game harder. \n\n\n\n\nThis is the game makers hoping you'll like their game enough to keep coming back for more, even after those ending credits scroll by. They are trying to reward the player for completing their game, and create some form of satisfying re-playability. If the game makers went to the trouble making things like this an integral part of the game, we as achievement developers should recognize these challenges and create appropriate achievements for at least a few of them.\n\n\nChrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story are famous for this. The Game Boy Advance Castlevania entries also do this. In fact, many games do this. If you aren't sure if your game has any extra modes or challenges, be sure to do some research and check out some FAQs. Or ask the community here, many of us are experts on the games supported here. \n\n\nSidequest/Optional Pros and Cons\nlink\n\n\nSidequest/Optional Achievements make fantastic supplements to Progression Achievements. \n\n\nPros\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the bread-and-butter of achievement making. Chances are, a good deal of your achievements will come from this category. All games have optional things to do. Collect all the coins in a stage! Gain 9 lives! Creating achievements for this stuff is easy, and it rewards the player for their dedication. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame makers love appreciative players. They like it when players bother to dig deeper into their games, appreciating their hard work, otherwise we wouldn't see hidden 'fun' things in games like Easter Eggs, bonus scenes, etc. If game makers reward the players for doing it, why shouldn't we? Us devs should also recognize that the player has gone the extra mile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame players love telling their friends when they find something unusual and off the beaten path in a game. With this site, they can show their friends that they did indeed slay the elusive 'yellow frog' rarely seen in the marsh, or found the warp to the 'mystery dimension'. If we include these curiosities in our achievement lists, we show the players that we are 'in the know', which builds confidence that we can competently guide them through the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidequest/Optional Achievements give players something to strive for after they've beaten the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese kinds of achievements can often be earned at any time and are not on a predictable schedule. Players feel an extra rush of endorphins when an achievement pops that they weren't expecting, but it was earned. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese kinds of achievements are usually easy to code, second only to progression-style achievements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome players don't care to explore beyond what a typical play-through has to offer, so a high percentage of these types of achievements in a game can leave a player under-rewarded. (Granted, this type of gamer is a bit of a rare bird on a website centered around achievements.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people may feel a specific challenge is too hard, even if it's something the original game developers included in-game for players to achieve. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create a Sidequest/Optional Achievement for, say, running away from 999 battles (or other stat-maxing achievements), you risk that the people on this website may not feel this particular achievement offers a challenge and is just a 'grind-fest'. Achievements like this may very well end up getting demoted unless they serve a second purpose, like in Final Fantasy V where running away from battles actually powers up a weapon called the 'Chicken Knife'. This has SYNERGY with the game, as opposed to creating an achievement based upon raising a stat that has no other use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection Based Achievements\nlink\n\n\nMost collection-based achievements are optional, unless the items themselves are MacGuffins, which in that case they would fall squarely under Progression/Collection.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nFinding the Mickey hats hidden in the background to obtain 1-ups in Genesis Aladdin. \n\n\nFinding exceptionally well-hidden items. \n\n\nBestiaries. \n\n\nUnlocking an optional character. \n\n\nMaxing out Money/kills/stats. \n\n\nFinding all the different ways to die in games like Prince of Persia or Shadowgate. \n\n\nOpening every treasure chest in a game/finding every powerup. \n\n\nAll items/Collecting 99 or 255 (etc.) of an item. \n\n\nCatching them all in Pokemon (any monster collection, really.) \n\n\n\n\nIf the game keeps track of a stat, the game developer is practically daring you to max it out. Now you might be that kind of player, and you might not. You have to ask yourself, as a dev, whether or not other players are likely to get 9999 vampire bat kills, even if you wouldn't. The advantages to this are that people who wouldn't normally do this always have something to come back and work for when they feel like playing the game again. The disadvantage is that other players who wouldn't normally go that far and never would, but also feel like they have to MASTER every game quickly (a rare breed), will complain. If you get enough complaints, you might want to bring down that 9999 to something more reasonable, like 500. If no one's having fun with an achievement, it's not in the spirit of playing games or making achievements. \n\n\nYou have to use your better judgment here and think of what the player would enjoy the most. As a rule of thumb, it's better to have a few Sidequest/Optional Achievements than none at all. But with a little extra effort, these achievements can make your list very memorable. \n\n\nNext, it's time to roll up our sleeves as devs and get REALLY creative when the devs themselves challenge the player beyond the rules of the game.\n\n\nFor-Fun achievements\nlink\n\n\nThis kind of achievements usually worths just a few points, but they are still fun\n\n\nExamples of For Fun:\n\n\n\n\nLetting the clock hit 99:59 in Valkyrie Profile. \n\n\nInteractive backgrounds, such as poking the hanging dead body in stage 1 of Castlevania: Bloodlines. \n\n\nCooking the hamster in the microwave in Maniac Mansion. \n\n\nWatching the apocalypse in Majora's Mask. \n\n\nFinding John Romero in Doom 2. \n\n\n\n\nSometimes, game makers add fun easter eggs. They went the extra mile to entertain the player with 'what if's'. Again, it is our job as devs to recognize and support these as much as we can.\n\n\nChallenges\nlink\n\n\nOne thing that you have to remember about retro gamers - and the games they play - is that most of us have played these games a million times before. This is the same old song and dance for most of us, and we often need motivation to do it again. Some of us can clear Contra without losing a single life. Well, now is our chance to prove it! \n\n\nI mean, think about it: Before this website, about the only way to prove you can do a flawless run of Contra was to invite a friend over, sit him down, and show him, or figure out recording software and make a YouTube video. But even then, a lot of those videos are doctored to look like flawless playthroughs. This site, however, has Hardcore mode, which help to indicate no one is cheating. \n\n\nYou may have Progression Achievements and Sidequest/Optional Achievements, but if you want to create an achievement list that's truly great, you need at least a few Challenge Achievements. Try to think back to all the games you've played here at this website. What are some of the most memorable achievements? I can almost guarantee you that they were Challenge Achievements. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the typical player isn't going to fondly recall, 'Cleared Stage 2-6', or 'Reached Level 30'. They are more likely to fondly remember achievements that made their play-throughs a unique experience, such as...\n\n\n\n\nget through the entire game without ever picking up a powerup or coin\n\n\ndefeat a boss without getting hit\n\n\nfinish a stage without losing a life\n\n\n\n\nThat is what makes this website so special, and what makes achievements something more than just beating a game. \n\n\nEven the most vocal critics who hate the idea of Achievements may say, \"Well, except for THIS one. This one was okay.\" And I guarantee you that ONE example they're talking about is a Challenge Achievement, something that challenged the player beyond the game itself. \n\n\nA good achievement developer will keep their eyes peeled, their wits about them, and their senses sharp when developing a game, looking for good, unusual challenges. They may notice something in the game that's a difficult feat.\n\n\nSpeedrun Challenges\nlink\n\n\nTimers introduce an added pressure players may have never felt before while playing their favorite games. Few things get the heart pumping more than an imposing ticking clock. Add a timer element, and a game that was previously so easy they could beat it blindfolded could suddenly be transformed into the ultimate gaming challenge of their lives. \n\n\nExamples of Speedrun Challenges:\n\n\n\n\nCompleting a game in under one hour. \n\n\nClearing a specific stage in under three minutes. \n\n\nUndercut the timer by a certain number of seconds. \n\n\nKill 30 vampire bats during the escape sequence. \n\n\nCollect 99 bonus coins before the bonus screen fades away. \n\n\nGo from point A to point B before day changes to night. \n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete the game with the fastest time possible. \n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete a given stage with the fastest time possible. \n\n\n\n\nA dev may want to head out to YouTube or Twitch and see how fast people are finishing a game (And please ignore TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Some pro speed-runners are so fast, the typical player here won't stand a chance at the times being posted, but you should be able to find a happy medium. And if you can't figure out a good time to challenge the players here, that's what Leaderboards are for - Turn it into a competition! In fact, some of your favorite celebrity speed-runners may come to this very site and submit a time or two. \n\n\nYou'll know when you're facing a pressure achievement when your palms are sweating and you find yourself nervously glancing at the timer. Like I said before, nothing screams, \"Wake up!\" louder than a timer, especially when developers start weaving this kind of achievement with OTHER kinds of achievements (and even leaderboards) during a timed portion of a game. Timer Challenges have an insane amount of synergy with other types of achievements. \n\n\nLimitation Challenges\nlink\n\n\nExamples of Limitation Challenges:\n\n\n\n\nClear a battle or even an entire game with all characters of a specific job class. (One famous example of this is clearing the original Final Fantasy with a group of White Mages.) \n\n\nBeat a final boss with no equipment on. \n\n\nClear a stage without ever jumping. \n\n\nSolve a puzzle in only two moves. \n\n\nOne-hit KOs. \n\n\nLow level games (LLGs). \n\n\nNo hit achievements. \n\n\nNever hit certain button(s) during a challenge. \n\n\nNever lose invincibility through an entire Mario 3 stage by finding enough Starmen. \n\n\nDefeat a certain enemy without using a certain move. \n\n\nReaching Ganon in Legend of Zelda, sword-less. \n\n\nDefeat a certain enemy ONLY using a certain move. \n\n\nStumble your way through a maze while drunk/confused. \n\n\nClear the game with a status ailment. \n\n\n\n\nCommunity websites built around certain games are a fantastic resource for these kinds of achievements They'll have a good idea about what's possible and impossible, and have likely written up FAQs discussing alternative and challenging ways to play the entire game. \n\n\nOften times, though, there will be no community. No FAQs. No Message Board. And maybe even no useful videos. In these cases, you'll need to be an idea person to come up with new and interesting ways to challenge the player. Be aware that these kinds of achievements take a lot of practice, time, and experience to create. \n\n\nThe takeaway here is to BE CREATIVE! And remember to keep it FUN! \n\n\nScore Challenges\nlink\n\n\nExamples of Score Challenges:\n\n\n\n\nCompleting a game or level with the lowest possible score. \n\n\nComplete a minigame with a perfect score (not just topping the CPU leaderboard). \n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete the game with the highest score/most money/best kill count/etc. possible. \n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete a given stage with the highest score/most money/best kill count/etc. possible. \n\n\n\n\nChallenge Pros and Cons\nlink\n\n\nChallenge Achievements are your chance to show players how to play their favorite games in different, unique, and even mind-bending ways. While these achievements can breathe life into an otherwise dull achievement set, you generally only want a small handful of these to be in your final list. \n\n\nPros\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardcore players love sinking their teeth into these kinds of achievements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf some players are too hardcore, you can find a happy medium by implementing Leaderboards, which satisfies both the casual achievement hunters and the hardcore players all at once. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is your chance to be very creative and come up with new challenges for players they never expected. This can be a pleasant surprise and really make your lists memorable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese types of achievements require a fair amount of creativity to dream up, though there are many ways to research unusual ways to play games by watching things like speed runs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay require a deep research. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese can be notoriously difficult to code. They require you to make a lot of code notes, make tons of game mechanic observations, and often times they require bug testing before they even work. In fact, you may not even be ready to tackle achievements like this until you've had a few games under your belt with a set of baseline achievements. Fortunately, Challenge Achievements can always be added later. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Resources\nlink\n\n\n\n\nBest practices achievement creation guide\n written by Jeff Sullivan, Developer Account Manager of XNA Developer Connection (XDC) regarding XBox 360 Achievements.\n\n\nMake them Work for it\n an achievement design guide written by by Darran Jamieson on 1 Jan 2013.\n\n\nThe Achievement Machine: Understanding Xbox 360 Achievements in Gaming Practices\n - by Mikael Jakobsson\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2018-05-08 16:36] meleu:\n fixed some lists formatation\n\n\n[2018-02-01 17:29] meleu:\n Updated Achievement Design (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-01-30 23:04] meleu:\n Updated Achievement Design (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-01-28 18:50] meleu:\n removed \"unique achievements\" section - it's the same thing as for-fun achievements\n\n\n[2018-01-28 14:57] meleu:\n added one more link to an external resource and put them at the end of the doc\n\n\n[2018-01-28 11:42] meleu:\n changed link to jeff sullivan article (better formatation)\n\n\n[2018-01-27 18:25] meleu:\n Updated Achievement Design (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-01-27 13:22] Kvon:\n added two links to guilds\n\n\n[2018-01-27 13:12] meleu:\n summing up the cirellio's posts\n\n\n[2017-11-28 06:02] meleu:\n Updated Achievement Design (markdown)",

            "text": "Progression-based achievements are usually simplest ones, especially if the game you are doing is nothing but linear stages. Or doesn't have much going on in the way of storylines. In this case, let's look at some GOOD and BAD examples of this:   Good: Clear stage 1.   Bad: Reach stage 2.    It takes slightly more work to code an achievement where the player is required to clear the stage rather than simply reach the next one. But it is also much more satisfying for the player, and it is much more professional-looking. It is also  less susceptible to problems with players loading save games or savestates for freebie achievements en masse .    Good: Complete the game.   Bad: Start the game.    While it is true progression-based achievements are often freebies, it is generally agreed upon here that an achievement to start the game is a bit too easy, and not at all memorable for the player. It's just a formality. The ending of the game, however, is often the most memorable part of a game for a player, and completing a game is definitely an achievement in itself. It's a good practice to make such achievement work like \"Beat last stage and beat the game\".   Good: Cleared the ice theme stages, or Cleared the first five stages, or Cleared the first ten stages.   Bad: Complete Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (all separate achievements)    One of the worst things you can do is create achievement spam. Puzzle games are notorious for these kinds of problems, because the stages are short and often, there are one-hundred of them or more. As a result, the main page feed ends up with a lot of micro-updates, which spams other folks' achievements down and off the front page quickly. The way to come off as more professional in this matter is to space out the achievements a bit more, into groups of stages. For instance, if stages 1-10 are all fire themed, and stages 11-20 are all outer-space themed, you can create achievements around these themes. Be creative.",

Finding out what will happen in the future in Chrono Trigger.   Launching the Cow in Earthworm Jim.   Pretty much any character death.    The thing you have to be extra-careful with here is spoilers. If you catch a progression-based achievement that has a spoiler in it, by all means contact the dev about it. And devs, please be receptive when it comes to constructive criticism!

Remember, a lot of folks are playing through these games for the very first time, and most games are quite hard to beat. Why shouldn't we reward players for a good ol' normal play-through?     Periodic progression awards go a long way to encourage players to complete a game.     Some players are more casual and don't intend to do much more than beat games on this website. Not everyone feels the need to Master every game in Hardcore mode. Many are perfectly happy grabbing whatever convenient side-achievements they can during a normal play-through, and there's nothing wrong with that.     Some scenes are so memorable, they deserve achievements all their own! People who grew up with these games and love them look for these scenes in achievement lists, and it might just warm their heart when they see it was acknowledged.     Progression Achievements help other people on the website gauge how far along a player is in a game, a bit like Rich Presence. We can drop a line to the player and say, \"Good luck!\" because we know the next section is pretty tricky. It encourages the community to interact.     Order matters! Progression Achievements can tell us a lot about a play-through just by the order they occurred. If you pop that optional boss achievement and saved up a million dollars AFTER you've already done all the sidequests, that's much less impressive than if you manage to pull it off well before the mid-point of the game. In other words, Progression Achievements allow us to show-off a bit! We can show the world that we can beat that final boss before we've reached level 10, or that we can beat Expert mode on our first go before Easy and Normal.  It can even reveal if we've used glitches or cheats to skip certain portions of the game . So, as you can see, Progression Achievements have great SYNERGY with other kinds of achievements.

You have to walk a fine tightrope between if dedicated players are likely to do something, vs. if the goal is stupid. People will have differing views over this, so steel yourself.  Often times, these types of achievements are even Easter Eggs or things the player never knew existed in their entire lives! Many players adore these types of achievements. I think it's because they learn something new about a game they grew up with, or feel like maybe they were the only ones who knew about a given secret and were excited to see it supported here.  It's important for us developers to REALLY know a game inside-and-out before creating an achievement set.  Examples of Sidequests:   Delivering tails to the Tail Collector in Final Fantasy IV.   Finding the owner of the Insignificant Item in Earthbound.   Giving the Jerky to the King in Guardia Castle.   Anju sidequest in Majora's Mask.   Learning about Wrex's past in Mass Effect.   Diplomat/VIP escort missions in Flashback: The Quest for Identity.   Discovering a secret room.    Sidequests are most often found in RPGs, but especially these days, sidequests are finding their way into just about every genre. Keep your eyes peeled - Even the unsuspecting platformer may have a sidequest or three. The Kirby series, for instance, has many hidden rooms and areas. Often times, sidequests end up awarding an item, which falls under a hybrid: Sidequest/Collection.",

This is the game makers hoping you'll like their game enough to keep coming back for more, even after those ending credits scroll by. They are trying to reward the player for completing their game, and create some form of satisfying re-playability. If the game makers went to the trouble making things like this an integral part of the game, we as achievement developers should recognize these challenges and create appropriate achievements for at least a few of them.  Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story are famous for this. The Game Boy Advance Castlevania entries also do this. In fact, many games do this.

They like it when players bother to dig deeper into their games, appreciating their hard work, otherwise we wouldn't see hidden 'fun' things in games like Easter Eggs, bonus scenes, etc. If game makers reward the players for doing it, why shouldn't we? Us devs should also recognize that the player has gone the extra mile.    Game players love telling their friends when they find something unusual and off the beaten path in a game. With this site, they can show their friends that they did indeed slay the elusive 'yellow frog' rarely seen in the marsh, or found the warp to the 'mystery dimension'. If we include these curiosities in our achievement lists, we show the players that we are 'in the know', which builds confidence that we can competently guide them through the game.     Sidequest/Optional Achievements give players something to strive for after they've beaten the game.    These kinds of achievements can often be earned at any time and are not on a predictable schedule.

Some people may feel a specific challenge is too hard, even if it's something the original game developers included in-game for players to achieve.     When you create a Sidequest/Optional Achievement for, say, running away from 999 battles (or other stat-maxing achievements), you risk that the people on this website may not feel this particular achievement offers a challenge and is just a 'grind-fest'. Achievements like this may very well end up getting demoted unless they serve a second purpose, like in Final Fantasy V where running away from battles actually powers up a weapon called the 'Chicken Knife'.

Maxing out Money/kills/stats.   Finding all the different ways to die in games like Prince of Persia or Shadowgate.   Opening every treasure chest in a game/finding every powerup.   All items/Collecting 99 or 255 (etc.) of an item.   Catching them all in Pokemon (any monster collection, really.)    If the game keeps track of a stat, the game developer is practically daring you to max it out. Now you might be that kind of player, and you might not. You have to ask yourself, as a dev, whether or not other players are likely to get 9999 vampire bat kills, even if you wouldn't. The advantages to this are that people who wouldn't normally do this always have something to come back and work for when they feel like playing the game again. The disadvantage is that other players who wouldn't normally go that far and never would, but also feel like they have to MASTER every game quickly (a rare breed), will complain. If you get enough complaints, you might want to bring down that 9999 to something more reasonable, like 500. If no one's having fun with an achievement, it's not in the spirit of playing games or making achievements.   You have to use your better judgment here and think of what the player would enjoy the most. As a rule of thumb, it's better to have a few Sidequest/Optional Achievements than none at all. But with a little extra effort, these achievements can make your list very memorable.

You may have Progression Achievements and Sidequest/Optional Achievements, but if you want to create an achievement list that's truly great, you need at least a few Challenge Achievements. Try to think back to all the games you've played here at this website. What are some of the most memorable achievements? I can almost guarantee you that they were Challenge Achievements. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the typical player isn't going to fondly recall, 'Cleared Stage 2-6', or 'Reached Level 30'. They are more likely to fondly remember achievements that made their play-throughs a unique experience, such as...   get through the entire game without ever picking up a powerup or coin  defeat a boss without getting hit  finish a stage without losing a life   That is what makes this website so special, and what makes achievements something more than just beating a game.   Even the most vocal critics who hate the idea of Achievements may say, \"Well, except for THIS one. This one was okay.\" And I guarantee you that ONE example they're talking about is a Challenge Achievement, something that challenged the player beyond the game itself.

            "text": "Game Icons\nlink\n\n\nIcons are \nuser uploaded\n images that are used throughout the site to represent a game. Due to their prominence on game and user pages they are worth special attention.\n\n\n\n\nSonic the Hedgehog's game Icon\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nDesigning new game Icons - styling guide\nlink\n\n\nWhen designing a new game icon consider the following: Much of the community prefers that \ngame Icons use art assets that were made for the original game;\n\n- from inside the game, \n- or for the game documents, \n- or for the game manual, \n- or for promotional material,\n- and so on; art created by the original team.\n\n\nUsing more current designs (or fan art) for classic video game characters might be seem appealing. But many find this is \ndisrespectful to the source material\n.\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility for the styling guide\nlink\n\n\n\n\nFor unlicensed games or \n~hacks~\n where there is little original art available non-official art might be reasonable.\n\n\nMaking modifications to the art assets available for would usually be reasonable.\n\n\nUsing outside or hand-made assets, say for a title or border, would be reasonable so long as the main subject uses official art.\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to follow this styling guide?\nlink\n\n\nThe style you choose for your designs is still up to you. You can break these rules so long as you do not break any copyright law, or upload anything vulgar, offensive or pornographic.\n\n\nOther Icon Design tips\nlink\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the \ngames list\n, to find Icons that speak to you. Mimic and innovate on the style of your favorites.\n\n\nMany of the \nBadge creation tips\n apply here as well.\n\n\n\n\nIcon file and size - best practices\nlink\n\n\n\n\nUploaded Icons should be square (have the same X and Y dimensions), otherwise the resulting image will be distorted and ugly.\n\n\nUpload using non-interlaced PNG format; avoid using a transparency layer as it will come out in the end with a flat white box.\n\n\nDesign images at 96x96 (preferred), 64x64, 48x48 or 32x32 for sharpest clarity. Icons and badges should be made in a way that the subject is clear even when sized at 32x32 as they are often reduced to this size, like on the global feed.\n\n\n\n\nUploading game Icons (Developer)\nlink\n\n\nAchievement Developers are allowed to change game Icons freely for entries that do not have achievements. As a Developer if you'd like to post a backup of the previous image there, if there is one, or backup yours in the forum you're free to but not required. As you create a new set of achievement you are free to create or choose the image you'd like to use as the game Icon.\n\n\nTo change a game Icon first go to the game page and click on the Dev tools:\n\n\n\n\nThen click the choose file button highlighted. Find the file on your PC, and then press the submit button highlighted:\n\n\n\n\nIf a game has existing achievements game Icon changes need to go through the \nIcon Gauntlet\n.\n\n\nUploading game Icons (non-Developer)\nlink\n\n\nYes, you absolutely can, but read the rules for the \nIcon Gauntlet\n. It will also be good to review the guidelines for \ndesigning new game Icons\n.\n\n\nGame Icon Gauntlet\nlink\n\n\nThe game Icon Gauntlet pits a user posted new Icons and Badges in a \nhead-to-head\n fight with the standing Icon. The \npopular vote\n which will take place in the \n#Icon-Gauntlet\n Discord channel and will determine which stays and which goes. All verified Discord users are eligible to cast their deciding vote. \nDrPixel\n is the manager of all aspects of this on ongoing contest.\n\n\nRules for Submitting a new game Icon\nlink\n\n\n\n\nAny verified RetroAchievments user can submit a new game Icon or Badges.\n\n\nOnly submit Icons and Badges for games that have existing achievements.\n\n\nIcon and Badge submissions must be related to the game or achievements; no lewd graphics.\n\n\nRecommended:\n Icons are best created at 96x96, 64x64 or 32x32. Create PNG image files for best quality.\n\n\nRecommended:\n Badges are best created at 64x64 or 32x32. Create PNG image files for best quality.\n\n\nPost them in \nthis forum topic\n.\n\n\nTo properly display the image post it using the image forum tag \n[img=http://YourImageURL.png]\n\n\nState the game that your Icon or Badges are intended to replace. (Even better use the \n[game=GameID]\n forum tag. You can see the game id by looking at the url of the game page)\n\n\nWhen posting a new set of Badges, post all the new images along side the old ones so they can easily be presented side-by-side publicly.\n\n\n\n\nThe Icon Gauntlet Vote\nlink\n\n\n\n\nThe vote takes place in the \n#Icon-Gauntlet\n Discord channel and open is to all Verified \n(green name)\n Discord users.\n\n\nNew votes are posted weekly and the vote lasts for the week.\n\n\nMajority wins.\n\n\nIn the event of a tie, there will be a revote.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to the image when you upload a game Icon\nlink\n\n\nWhen uploaded, your Icon images are reduced to a maximum 96x96 32-bit colour PNG. If you upload an Icon that is smaller than 96x96 the image uploaded will retain its original size. \n\n\nThe same is true for Badges, except Badges maximum size is 64x64. (Profile images maximum is 128x128.)\n\n\nIcon server files\nlink\n\n\nIcons are stored on the site in the following manner and place: \ni.retroachievements.org/Images/000705.png\n. They are stored in the same server folder as other game images such as the game box and game screenshots. \n\n\nAchievement Badges\nlink\n\n\nBadges are the user created images for individual achievements of a game.\n\n\n\n\nSonic the Hedgehog's first Badge - #00199)\n\n  ## \n\n\n\n\nBadge creation guidelines and tips\nlink\n\n\n\n\nBadges should refer in some way to what the achievement is about - i.e. a picture of the boss, level or collectible that the achievement requires the player to get to. \n\n\nCheck out the designs of some of your favorite games. Some users go to great effort to make visually appealing badges:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a \nforum topic\n full of great tips. \n\n\nIn the cases of low-resolution games' achievements, it can be hard to get a Badge looking good without it looking \nblocky\n or \nblurry\n, in these cases the \nblocky\n look is often preferable, so that the images have a \nretro\n feel to them.\n\n\nYou can make each Badge have little rounded borders like an actual Badge or some extra spiky corners for emphasis or a king's crown for difficult ones.  Its your design.  It should visually represent the achievement itself, or hint at the location in the game for secrets.\n\n\nMatching to the game's art style works well.

You can make each Badge have little rounded borders like an actual Badge or some extra spiky corners for emphasis or a king's crown for difficult ones.  Its your design.

It genuinely takes some care and attention to get a good leaderboard working, so in this doc we'll try to understand how it works.\n\n\nOverview\nlink\n\n\nThis is how a game's Leaderboard List looks like on the website:\n\n\n\n\nIn the center you can see every already made Leaderboard, and in the right column you can see the \nCode Notes\n for the game. The Code Notes are here to help with some conditions we'll see below.\n\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each field of a single Leaderboard:\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: the leaderboard's title.\n\n\nDescription\n: the leaderboard's description.\n\n\nFormat\n: it can be \nScore\n, \nTime (Frames)\n, \nTime (Milliseconds)\n or \nValue\n. It's used to distinguish what sort of leaderboard this is (we'll go into this below).\n\n\n\"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox\n: when checked, it means that a lower value is a better thing. It's usually the case for time based leaderboards, whereas a larger score generally is better.\n\n\nStart\n: start conditions, aka \nSTA\n.\n\n\nCancel\n: cancel conditions, aka \nCAN\n.\n\n\nSubmit\n: submit conditions, aka \nSUB\n.\n\n\nValue\n: a value interpreter, aka \nVAL\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: A valid leaderboard MUST have all four of these conditions.\n\n\nThose last 4 fields are really important and \nLOTS\n of care must be taken over the entry of any characters into these strings. That's why they deserve a further explanation:\n\n\nThe \nSTA\n or \nStart\n condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. Once the \nSTA\n is true, the game will activate the other three, and will keep processing them constantly.\n\n\nIf a \nCancel\n (\nCAN\n) condition is true, then it will cancel the leaderboard and no score will be submitted. \n\n\nIf the \nSubmit\n (\nSUB\n) condition is true, then the leaderboard score will be submitted.

We're going to use the \nGreen Hill Act 1 (Sonic the Hedgehog) Leaderboard\n for this purpose. Then let's see how it looks:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nTitle/Description\n fields are quite obvious.\n\n\nThe \nType\n is \"Time (Frames)\". In Sonic every 60 frames is 1 second, then we'll monitor the time using the frames.\n\n\nThe \nLower Is Better\n flag is checked, then the one who makes the shortest time will be the #1.\n\n\nNow we're going to break down the most important parts.\n\n\nStart Conditions\nlink\n\n\nSTA\n: \n0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10=h0000\n: If 16-bit RAM address 0xfe10 is equivalent to hex 0000,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\n0xhf601=h0c\n: If 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is equivalent to hex 0c,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\nd0xhf601!=h0c\n: If the previous 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is NOT equivalent to hex 0c,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\n0xfff0=0\n If 16-bit RAM address 0xfff0 is equivalent to 0.\n\n\n\n\nThis might seem daunting, because we don't know what these addresses mean. That's why the \nCode Notes\n in the right column are pretty handy! You can see how these addresses are labelled in memory. In our example we have:\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10\n is the level, and is expected to be \n0\n (the first level).\n\n\n0xf601\n is an 8-bit memory address, and we use the prefix \n0xh\n instead of \n0x\n to signify this. The \n0xf601\n is the screen mode. The second and third parts of the start statement are saying \"the current mode should be \ningame\n (\n0c\n), and the mode on the previous frame should NOT be \ningame\n\". \nNote\n: that \nd\n prefix on the address represents delta, or \"the previous frame's value\". \nSumming up:\n trigger this if we've JUST arrived in a level (the start of the level, when we want to start testing their time).\n\n\nFinally we also expect \n0xfff0\n to be equivalent to \n0\n, because this address is used for demo mode, and we don't want to award a leaderboard entry when the demo is active!\n\n\n\n\nTip\n: the most common mistake when creating leaderboards is forgetting the \nh\n when trying to reference an 8-bit memory address.\n\n\nPro-tip:\n \nSTA\n, \nCAN\n, and \nSUB\n support all logic available in the \nachievement editor\n. The easiest way to make sure you get them written correctly is to create local achievements that capture the events, then extract the serialized values from the \"XXX-User.txt\" file associated to the game you're working on.\n\n\nNote\n: You can use HitCounts in the Start/Submit/Cancel triggers, but you are responsible for resetting them. These triggers are evaluated every frame, and the state of the leaderboard is dependent on which ones are true. As such, the HitCount will increment even when the leaderboard is not active unless you have an explicit ResetIf condition.\n\n\nCancel Conditions\nlink\n\n\nCAN\n: \n0xhfe13<d0xhfe13\n\n\n\n\n0xfe13 is the number of lives.\n\n\n\n\nThe cancel section checks if the player's LIVES counter ever becomes lower. Literally, it says \"Cancel if the CURRENT value at 0xfe13 is less than the PREVIOUS value at 0xfe13\". We want to do this because you could reach the final checkpoint and run out of time, resetting your timer to 0:00. We don't want to allow this, because it's not the correct way of completing the level. So if the player dies, we reset their leaderboard progress. Finally, if you connect two cancel conditions with \ns\n, the leaderboard will cancel when either one of them are true.\n\n\nSubmit Conditions\nlink\n\n\nSUB\n: \n0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0\n\n\n\n\n0xf7cc is the endlevel flag, non-interactive.\n\n\n\n\nThe submit section checks if the current frame has the 'endlevel' flag set to true (or \n!=0\n, 'nonzero'), and the previous frame (delta) has it set to false (or \n=0\n, 'zero'). This suggests that the player has reached the end of the level, and has proven to be a fairly sturdy benchmark.\n\n\nTip\n: it can be useful to watch these values in memory to see how they perform, and what sort of values they end up at in different circumstances.\n\n\nValue Interpreter\nlink\n\n\nSee also: \nBinary Coded Decimal\n\n\nVAL\n: \n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nFinally, value. Once the player has reached the start condition, they will be shown a popup which remains on-screen, showing their progress so far. If it's a time leaderboard, it will be a clock, and if it's a score, it will just be the value. If they fulfill the cancel condition, they will be told that they have failed, and the popup will be removed. If they successfully reach the submit condition, the current value will be taken and submitted as their score, and on successful submission, an ingame popup will inform the player of the leaderboard so far, and their position in the leaderboard.\n\n\nThe value condition is special in a few ways. It is evaluated constantly and shown on-screen all the time when the leaderboard is active. It doesn't work like the other conditions, it expects addresses in the following way:\n\n\naddress*modifier\n (address times modifier)\n\n\nand it uses the \n_\n underscore operator as a 'plus'. The \n*\n asterisk signifies 'multiply', so in the value\n\n\n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nrepresents:\n\n\n8-bit 0xfe24 times 1, PLUS\n8-bit 0xfe25 times 60, PLUS\n8-bit 0xfe22 times 3600\n\n\nThe reason for this is that the values in each of these addresses signifies frames, seconds, and minutes respectively. When we add these values together, we get a grand total in frames that we submit to the database.\n\n\nRemember that 'Format' field that can be either \nScore\n, \nTime (Frames)\n, \nTime (Milliseconds)\n or \nValue\n? \nTime (Frames)\n is the most common one, and represents 'frames'. \nTime (Milliseconds)\n expects a value that we can convert directly into millisecs (Super Mario Kart uses this). However to convert a value in frames into a human-readible format, we should divide the value by 60 to get an accurate representation of seconds, and a value in millisecs should be divided by 100 to get the number of seconds. This is used both on the website and in the app to display the value properly, and is important to distinguish so we can be sure we get the most accurate value out of the emulator, by using whatever format they use to record time.\n\n\nThere is also a symbol which only works in this field. Connecting two value conditions with \n$\n will cause only the one with the highest value to be used.\n\n\nNOTE\n: \nTime (Milliseconds)\n is actually hundredths of a second, not thousandths of a second. i.e. a Value of 6234 would be 62.34 seconds, not 6.234 seconds.\n\n\nTip\n: modifier is a decimal value, so if you need to divide by two, you can multiply by 0.5: \n0xhfe24*0.5\n\n\nValue from HitCount\nlink\n\n\nStarting with the 0.77 DLL (and RetroArch 1.8.2), you can use the Measured flag to count the number of times something happens and submit that as the value. To do so, your Value field should look like a trigger that only has one Measured condition. You can use AddHits, AddSource, SubSource, AddAddress, and AndNext in conditions leading up to the Measured condition for more complex measurements. \n\n\nThe HitCount on the condition will automatically be set to 0 when the leaderboard starts, and the HitCount will be submitted as the Value when the leaderboard submit trigger activates. Do not include an explicit Hit target, or that will be the maximum value that can be submitted.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nM:0xH1234!=d0xH1234\n\n\n\n\nWould submit the number of times the byte at $1234 changed while the leaderboard was active.\n\n\nN:0xH1234!=20_M:0xH1234!=d0xH1234\n\n\n\n\nWould submit the number of times the byte at $1234 changed to something other than 20 while the leaderboard was active.\n\n\nSince this is trigger syntax, you cannot use multiplication or any of the other value-specific flags mentioned in the previous section.\n\n\nFurther help\nlink\n\n\nThere are unfortunately \nMANY\n ways to get this process wrong, so if you are having any trouble feel free to ask for help in our \nDiscord server\n.\n\n\nIf you want to practice, it's highly recommended to create your own leaderboard and attempting something on a new game, rather than using an existing leaderboard.\n\n\nPlease remember that these files are pulled directly into someone's game if they decide to play it, and a badly formed memory address or string could cause their emulator to crash, so please test your leaderboard code!\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-12-24 15:27] Jamiras:\n add Value from HitCount section and note about using hit counts in STA/SUB/CAN\n\n\n[2019-05-15 17:53] meleu:\n recover\n\n\n[2019-05-15 10:21] eldexterr:\n Updated Leaderboards (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-11-20 07:41] Scott:\n Updated Leaderboards (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-11-20 07:39] Scott:\n Updated Leaderboards (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-11-20 07:38] Scott:\n Updated Leaderboards (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-11-20 07:31] Scott:\n Updated Leaderboards (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-11-20 07:30] Scott:\n Updated Leaderboards (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-10-23 18:20] Kvon:\n fixed link\n\n\n[2018-10-23 18:19] Kvon:\n Added quick link for BCD. this really should be expanded",

The Code Notes are here to help with some conditions we'll see below.  Here's a brief explanation of each field of a single Leaderboard:   Title : the leaderboard's title.  Description : the leaderboard's description.  Format : it can be  Score ,  Time (Frames) ,  Time (Milliseconds)  or  Value . It's used to distinguish what sort of leaderboard this is (we'll go into this below).  \"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox : when checked, it means that a lower value is a better thing. It's usually the case for time based leaderboards, whereas a larger score generally is better.  Start : start conditions, aka  STA .  Cancel : cancel conditions, aka  CAN .  Submit : submit conditions, aka  SUB .  Value : a value interpreter, aka  VAL .   Note : A valid leaderboard MUST have all four of these conditions.  Those last 4 fields are really important and  LOTS  of care must be taken over the entry of any characters into these strings. That's why they deserve a further explanation:  The  STA  or  Start  condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. Once the  STA  is true, the game will activate the other three, and will keep processing them constantly.  If a  Cancel  ( CAN ) condition is true, then it will cancel the leaderboard and no score will be submitted.   If the  Submit  ( SUB ) condition is true, then the leaderboard score will be submitted. NOTE: Cancel is given priority over Submit. If both become true in the same frame, the score will not be submitted.  Finally, the  Value  ( VAL ) is a special case, and will be taken from memory using the formula stated in the memory box. This is the score that gets displayed while the leaderboard is active, and the value that's submitted if  SUB  is true.  NOTE: Once an active leaderboard is cancelled or submitted, it cannot be reactivated until the  Start  condition becomes false, then true again.

The Script checks the player's game memory and as programmed reports the values of certain addresses with definitions assigned by the Developer such as which stage the player is on, how many lives they have, if the game is paused, what game mode they are playing, what the player has accomplished, etc. This information is reported back to the website. \nEvery game published should have at least a basic RPS.\n\n\nExample of RP in action:\n\n\n  \n\n\nTo see the RP live in a game click on the RetroAchievements menu in your emulator and then click on Rich Presence Monitor.

It will also request a Rich Presence Script for the currently loaded ROM. The emulator will report back to the website every 120 seconds. Similarly, every 120 seconds or so, the 'active players' box on the front page will refresh, detailing the last known activity of all active players. If there isn't a rich presence script given, the text will be 'earning achievements' if playing a game with achievements, 'playing [game]' if playing a game without achievements, or 'developing achievements' if the memory dialog is open and visible. \n\n\nThe RPS for each game can be found under the development section on each game's page: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (Super Mario Bros.)\nlink\n\n\nFormat:Digit\nFormatType=VALUE\n\nLookup:Mode\n0=[Demo] \n2=[World Complete] \n\nLookup:Paused\n0x81=\u258c\u258c \n0x80=\u258c\u258c \n1=\u258c\u258c \n\nLookup:Star\n5=\ud83c\udf1f \n4=\ud83c\udf1f \n3=\ud83c\udf1f \n2=\ud83c\udf1f \n1=\ud83c\udf1f \n\nLookup:Powerup\n0=Small\n1=Super\n2=Fire\n\nLookup:Swimming\n1= swimming\n\nLookup:Status\n0= [Loading]\n1= taking a vine warp\n2= entering a warp pipe\n3= entering a warp pipe\n4= \ud83d\udea9\n5= [Stage Complete]\n6= [Game Over]\n7= [Entering Area]\n9= growing\n0xA= shrinking\n0xB= \ud83d\udc80\n0xC= powering up\n\nLookup:Quest\n0x0=1st\n0x1=2nd\n\nDisplay:\n@Mode(0xh770)@Paused(0xh776)@Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f)@Powerup(0xh0756) Mario in @Digit(0xh75f_v1)-@Digit(0xh75c_v1)@Swimming(0xh704)@Status(0xhe), \ud83d\udeb6:@Digit(0xh75a_v1), @Quest(0xh7fc) Quest\n\n\n\n\nIt breaks down into a series of Lookup objects, Format objects and one Display object. \n\n\nLookups\nlink\n\n\nLookups are defined like this: \n\n\nLookup:NameOfLookup\nValue1=Text When This Value\nValue2=Text When Another Value\n...\n\n\n\n\nWe give the Lookup a value, consisting of a series of memory addresses and modifiers.

It refers to the previously defined Lookup and Format objects using a single '@'. It then specifies a name for the lookup or format (case sensitive!), and immediately after, in brackets, a series of memory values specifying what to send to that lookup or format object.\n\n\n@Powerup(0xh756)\n \n\n\nThis means use the Lookup or Format that's called \nPowerup\n, and give it whatever value is in 0xh756. \n\n\nExample Lookup Breakdown\nlink\n\n\n\n\n@Mode(0xh770)\n - Lookup for the address that shows if the game is in demo mode or a world has been completed.  \n\n\n@Paused(0xh776)\n - Lookup for the address that shows if the game is paused (3 values are used, two of them are for pausing and unpausing).  \n\n\n@Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f)\n - Lookup for the address of if Mario has Star invincibility. More on this later.  \n\n\n@Powerup(0xh756)\n - Lookup for the address that show if Mairo is Small, big or has fire power.  \n\n\nMario in\n - Static text to string lookup and format objects together.  \n\n\n@Digit(0xh75f_v1)\n - \nDigit\n is a format object defined as a value. The address 0xh75f is the World minus 1 (because it it 0 based, as in it starts counting at 0). \n_v1\n Means + value 1. \n_v+1\n is also correct.  \n\n\n-\n - More static text to split World and Level. as in the hypen in World 1-1.  \n\n\n@Digit(0xh75c_v1)\n - Another use of the \nDigit\n format object. This time It's looking up the stage. World 1-X.  \n\n\n@Swimming(0xh704)\n - Lookup for the address that shows if the player is swimming.  \n\n\n@Status(0xhe)\n - Lookup for the address that shows Mario's status, such as going through pipes.  \n\n\n, \ud83d\udeb6:\n - More static text. \ud83d\udeb6 is a symbol for lives.  \n\n\n@Digit(0xh75a_v1)\n - Third use of the \nDigit\n format object. This time it's checking the player lives address.  \n\n\n,\n - Static text.  \n\n\n@Quest(0xh7fc)\n A lookup to see if the player is in normal or on the 2nd quest, hardmode.  \n\n\nQuest\n - Static Text.  \n\n\n\n\nAddress size\nlink\n\n\nTo specify what size of address you are are checking there are various characters used.

If the next line starts with a question mark, it is considered to be a conditional display string. The portion of the line between the two question marks is the conditional clause. If the conditional clause evaluates true, then the remaining portion of the line is used as the display string. If it does not evaluate true, then processing proceeds to the next line. If it starts with a question mark, the same process repeats. If it does not start with a question mark, the entire line is used as the default display string.\n\n\nNOTE\n: A default display string is required in case none of the conditional display strings match. If you only have conditional display strings, the script will appear to do nothing.\n\n\nLooking at this example, if the 16-bit value at $0085 is 0, the display string is \nTitle Screen\n. If not, the next line is examined. If the 7th bit of $007C is 1, the display string is \nCustom Map in @Landscape(0xH00016c)\n. If not, the final line does not have a conditional clause and is used.\n\n\nDisplay strings associated with a conditional clause support all of the same syntax as the default display string. In this example, you can see the \n@Landscape\n lookup is used in both the conditional display string and the default display string. The lookup itself only has to be defined once.\n\n\nThe conditional phrase supports all of the previously mentioned address accessors as well as AND (_) and OR (S) logic. Note that OR clauses still require a 'core' group, \njust like achievements\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?0xH1234=32_0xH2345=0?and example\n\n\nif the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 \nand\n the 8-bit value at $2345 is 0, display \nand example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?0xH1234=32S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?or example\n\n\nif the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 \nand\n the 8-bit value at $2345 is 1 \nor\n 2, display \nor example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?0xH1234=32_0xH5678=33S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?and/or example\n\n\nif the 8-bit value at $1234 is 32 \nand\n the 8-bit value at $5678 is 33 \nand\n the 8-bit value at $2345 is 1 \nor\n 2, display \nand/or example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinary Coded Decimal (BCD)\nlink\n\n\nBCD is when the values are store in an address from as 0-9 (one digit) or 0-99 (two digits). Keep in mind that most often values are stored in hexidecimal, but sometime games will store them in this way and here's the best way to handle these addresses in your display.\n\n\nBCD decoding treats each hex character as a decimal digit. If the memory inspector shows 86 (in hex), the result of BCD decoding the value would be 86 (in decimal).\n\n\nFor value objects you can use the BCD prefix, as in \nb0xh1234\n. This also works with \nleaderboard values\n.\nNote that you still need to specify the size of the BCD memory address. \nb0x1234\n reads a 16-bit value. \nb0xh1234\n reads an 8-bit value and \nb0xX1234\n reads a 32-bit value.\n\nNOTE\n: Support for 16-bit and 32-bit BCD decoding is a feature of the 0.075 toolkit.\n\n\nThis is most commonly used for score and time, but often other types of display values.\n\n\nLimits\nlink\n\n\n\n\n16,000 character limit for script  \n\n\n100 character limit for what is displayed  \n\n\nUnicode characters are allowed\n\n\n\n\nSyntax Details\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLookup keys are decimal by default and hex if you place the prefix of \n0x\n. This mean \n1\n == \n0x1\n, \n2\n == \n0x2\n, \n9\n == \n0x9\n, \n10\n == \n0xa\n, \n100\n == \n0x64\n, etc.  \n\n\nLookup/Format names are case specific and must exactly match the usage in the Display string: \n@test(0x1234)\n will not find \"Format:Test\"\n\n\nLookup/Format cannot contain spaces before or after the lookup name. \n@test(0x1234)\n will not find \"Format:test   \" or \"Format:   test\"\n\n\nIf your Lookup/Format cannot be found, nothing will be displayed. \nThis is a @test(0x1234).\n will result in \nThis is a .\n if \ntest\n cannot be found.\n\n\nComments can be added anywhere in the script. A double slash (\n//\n) indicates the remaining portion of the line should be ignored when processing the script. Note: comments still apply toward the script size limit.\n\n\n\n\nTips and Tricks\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLookup names can be as short as a single character if you need to squeeze in a few extra characters.\n\n\nLeading zeros can be removed from addresses (\n0xh0001\n can be shortened to \n0xh1\n).\n\n\nTurning all your values from hex into decimal will take up less characters.\n\n\nUnicode characters don't always \"take up less space\" they often take up to four system characters.\n\n\nIf a lookup doesn't contain a mapping for a value, it will result in a blank (no space) value. You can change this behavior by adding a single line to the lookup mapping '*' to the desired fallback value.\n\n\nEach \nLookup\n or \nFormat\n named mapping can be referenced multiple times with the same or different addresses. You can define a single \nFormat:Number FormatType=VALUE\n instead of defining individual ones for Lives, Score, Level, etc.\n\n\nPutting spaces in your lookups sometimes before or after can allow you to hide certain lookups when they are not needed, like how \n@Pause\n, \n@Star\n, \n@Swimming\n, and @Mode do. \n\n\n\n\nValue Properties\nlink\n\n\nWhen using lookup and format objects \n@object()\n it's possible to combine and perform calculations. This can be used to correctly display a score, in game time, etc. or make more advanced lookups.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n@Score(0x28*10_0x29*1000_0x26*100000) points\n \n\n\nThis means use the Lookup or Format \nScore\n, and give it the sum of:\n\n- 0x28 times 10, ADD\n\n- 0x29 times 1000, ADD\n\n- 0x26 times 100000  \n\n\n\n\n_\n adds the addresses together.  \n\n\nOr you can add a static value \n0x28_v10\n. This adds 10 to your total, as in whatever the value of \n0x28\n + 10 will be displayed. You can also subtract \n0x28_v-10.\n  \n\n\nIf you'd like to subtract an address you need to multiply the address by -1. \n0x29*-1\n. \n0x29\n is now negative.  \n\n\nIf you'd like to perform division you'll need to multiply by a decimal.  \n0x26*.5\n. \n0x26\n will output 1/2 of the value at \n0x26\n.  \n\n\nAnd you can string everything together: \n0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10\n.\n\n\nYou can also add addresses together to give you lookups based on the sums of various addresses. This is used in the example in @Star. It's looking up sum the 6 lowest bits of the address 0xh79f. The way this address works is that so long as there is a value there Mario is invincible star mario and it counts down from hex value 0x23 (35 decimal) to 0. 23 in binary is 0010 0011 meaning the max sum of these bits could 5 during 0001 1111 when the count down reaches hex value 0x1f (31 decimal).\n\n\n\n\nUnicode Standard Symbols\nlink\n\n\nYou can without doubt use these symbols in rich presence.\n\n\n\u258c\u258c=Paused\n\n\ud83d\udd01=Continues\n\n\u23f0=In Game Time/Game Clock\n\n\ud83d\udd11=Keys\n\n\ud83d\udca3=Bombs\n\n\u2764\ufe0f or \u2764=In a game with hearts (e.g. Zelda) \n\n\ud83d\udcb0=Money\n\n\ud83d\udea9=Level/Stage   \n\n\nWhile making Rich Presence devs need to be careful that they are communicating clearly. If you are using non-standard symbols they will make sense to you but could be entirely confusing to others. \nWhen using non-standard symbols, check them with someone else\n or a few people to see if the symbols you use make sense. If they don't, use better symbols, use text or use symbols alongside of text.\n\n\nFor custom unicode/emoji \nShapeCatcher\n is an excellent resource, you can draw what you're looking for and an AI will find similar matches. Just be careful to not use unicode that \ntoo obscure\n, as they don't all display on all systems.\n\n\nTake note of community display preference:\n\n\n\nDeveloping Rich Presence\nlink\n\n\nThe toolkit does not currently have an integrated Rich Presence editor, but you can test local changes before putting them on the server. Once you've started a game and the current Rich Presence has been downloaded from the server, you can find it in \nRACache\\Data\\XXX-Rich.txt\n where XXX is the game ID. \n\n\nThe Rich Presence Monitor (openable from the RetroAchievments menu) reads this file and shows the current value every second while the window is open.\n\n\nIf you make changes to the \nXXX-Rich.txt\n file, and reselect the menu option, it will read the new changes and allow you to immediate test them without applying the changes to the server. Continue to make changes and reselect the menu option until the script is behaving as you expect, then copy the contents to the server page to make it available to everyone else.\n\n\nNOTE\n: The \nXXX-Rich.txt\n file is overwritten with the current server data each time the game is opened. As long as you still have the file open in an editor, you can always save your changes over the updated file after reopening the game.\n\n\nParse Errors\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nEnum\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2\n\n\nINVALID_MEMORY_OPERAND\n\n\nA memory operand was expected and not found.

If the next line starts with a question mark, it is considered to be a conditional display string. The portion of the line between the two question marks is the conditional clause. If the conditional clause evaluates true, then the remaining portion of the line is used as the display string. If it does not evaluate true, then processing proceeds to the next line. If it starts with a question mark, the same process repeats. If it does not start with a question mark, the entire line is used as the default display string.  NOTE : A default display string is required in case none of the conditional display strings match. If you only have conditional display strings, the script will appear to do nothing.  Looking at this example, if the 16-bit value at $0085 is 0, the display string is  Title Screen . If not, the next line is examined.

BCD decoding treats each hex character as a decimal digit. If the memory inspector shows 86 (in hex), the result of BCD decoding the value would be 86 (in decimal).

Unicode characters don't always \"take up less space\" they often take up to four system characters.  If a lookup doesn't contain a mapping for a value, it will result in a blank (no space) value. You can change this behavior by adding a single line to the lookup mapping '*' to the desired fallback value.  Each  Lookup  or  Format  named mapping can be referenced multiple times with the same or different addresses. You can define a single  Format:Number FormatType=VALUE  instead of defining individual ones for Lives, Score, Level, etc.  Putting spaces in your lookups sometimes before or after can allow you to hide certain lookups when they are not needed, like how  @Pause ,  @Star ,  @Swimming , and @Mode do.",

Rev A), official and unofficial fix patches, and over regions.\n\n\nBonus Sets\n are an exception to this rule, but are considered an extension to a standard set and follow different rules for what types of achievements are allowed.\n\n\nROM Selection\nlink\n\n\nAlmost every game has multiple ROM versions out there, sometimes dozens. Often there are major differences under the hood to the point where for one game, one ROM will not be compatible with the achievements of another ROM of the same game. Thus, finding the best ROM for achievements is important and should be done carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion Selection\n: Where possible choose no-intro \nNTSC USA\n release ROMs, because 60 FPS is a smoother gaming experience.  \nPAL European\n releases run at 50 FPS, and are to be avoided in most cases.  \nNTSC Japan\n releases also run at 60 FPS , but is only the best choice if the game was a Japan-exclusive release.  Needing to resort to a \nPAL European\n release game should be a last resort case (Europe-only exclusive), and is typically a very select few \nunique\n games from the entire console's library. The PAL/NTSC issue does not apply to GBA emulation, which runs all region versions at the same FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Mods\n: Do not use a ROM with a modded/custom launch screen like Mode7 and RisingSun have because it messes up RAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Trainers\n: Do not use a ROM that includes an integrated cheat feature.  These are most often refereed to as after-market \nROM trainers\n, are not official, and not in any way supported by Retro Achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo-Intro\nlink\n\n\nNo-Intro\n ROMs are the preferred type of ROMs to be linked in the RA database, and should be the ones that you should use to make your set where possible. They filter out bad dumps, hacks, fakes, overdumps, underdumps, etc. and only display the ROMs that are most accurate to the original cartridge. No-Intro ROMs can be identified by the following naming scheme:\n\n\nGame Name (Region) (Available Languages if Applicable) (Current Revision if Applicable)\n\n\nExample:\n  Diddy Kong Racing (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev A)\n\n\nGoodTools \nGame Name (Region) [!]\n, as well as some of the \nGame Name (Region) (Rom Dumper Group)\n ROMs from an earlier era might match those in the No-Intro database but it is not guaranteed.\n\n\nYou can verify that your ROM checksum matches the No-Intro database \nhere\n. Unfortunately some of the RA Emulators don't calculate the checksum correctly (namely NES) so you may need to find your ROM checksum from \nanother source\n.\n\n\nTranslation patches\nlink\n\n\n(see also: \nROM Localization Policy\n below)\n\n\nEnglish is the Primary language of RetroAchievements. Translation Patches are sometimes applied by developers to non-English titles as the main MD5 for an achievement set where no licenced English version exists. In these cases patching instructions will be provided in the forum thread of that title. Providing an up-to-spec translation patch for an existing title is possibly allowed to make a game more accessible to other native language speakers. You must deep-memory inspect your translation contribution against the core set and submit it for approval before handing it over to the developer of the set for posting in their thread along with the game.\n\n\nSometimes translation patches may critically differ from the developer MD5 in memory differences that you may find online. Before linking these patches check with the original developer or do deep memory tests to ensure total compatibility. You can link translation patches you find online to core sets as long as the game's core achievements all function correctly and do not make the game more or less difficult.\n\n\nROM Localization Policy\nlink\n\n\nAs English is the primary language of the community, English ROMs are preferred. When choosing which ROM to build achievements out of various regional versions we give priority to \nNo-Intro US ROMs for non-handheld consoles\n and \nEuropean ROMs for handheld consoles\n. \n\n\nWe welcome and would like to continue improving our support for all regional versions, especially Japanese (as the majority of our game library was created in Japan). Also, some users simply prefer a specific regional version of a game and it is better to include broad support so that any good ROM can link to a good entry and give appropriate achievements.\n\n\nWhen looking at how games with regional versions are handled our standard is \none entry per game per console\n. It is ideal that if one loads up the US or Japanese version of Donkey Kong, Pac-Man or Contra, they will earn the same achievements from the same entry. But there are some situations where it is better for our library and players to split off regional versions into their own unique entry. If the community has reason to believe that it's better for an entry to be split it can be reviewed and approved by the developer team after a discussion and vote.\n\n\nTip:\n For games with text-triggered achievements (especially RPGs) it's recommend to find an event flag instead of hooking onto text or text ID. Text presentation varies between regional versions making multi-region support difficult.\n\n\nLocalization Differences\nlink\n\n\nThe types of changes made during localization (most commonly from Japanese to English) can vary wildly. Any of the following changes may result from a localization:\n\n\n\n\nLittle or no change at all;\n\n\nPasswords replace battery saves;\n\n\nBugs fixed;\n\n\nLight or extensive translations;\n\n\nLight or extensive cosmetic changes including elements considered offensive censored, sfx changes, or licenced assets being made generic, or unknown characters becoming Nintendoed (e.g. Tetris Attack, Super Mario Bros. 2);\n\n\nStages added, modified or removed;\n\n\nGame physics and game mechanics modified;\n\n\nGame modes, difficulty levels and game options added or removed;\n\n\nCheat codes or debug modes added or removed;\n\n\nThe game is rebalanced making it harder or easier, sometimes significantly;\n\n\nTwo games are combined into one;\n\n\nAnd more.\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this variance and to avoid filling the database with unnecessary duplicates our goal is to minimize the number of split sets.

Often there are major differences under the hood to the point where for one game, one ROM will not be compatible with the achievements of another ROM of the same game. Thus, finding the best ROM for achievements is important and should be done carefully.    Region Selection : Where possible choose no-intro  NTSC USA  release ROMs, because 60 FPS is a smoother gaming experience.   PAL European  releases run at 50 FPS, and are to be avoided in most cases.   NTSC Japan  releases also run at 60 FPS , but is only the best choice if the game was a Japan-exclusive release.  Needing to resort to a  PAL European  release game should be a last resort case (Europe-only exclusive), and is typically a very select few  unique  games from the entire console's library. The PAL/NTSC issue does not apply to GBA emulation, which runs all region versions at the same FPS.    No Mods : Do not use a ROM with a modded/custom launch screen like Mode7 and RisingSun have because it messes up RAM.    No Trainers : Do not use a ROM that includes an integrated cheat feature.  These are most often refereed to as after-market  ROM trainers , are not official, and not in any way supported by Retro Achievements.",

You must deep-memory inspect your translation contribution against the core set and submit it for approval before handing it over to the developer of the set for posting in their thread along with the game.  Sometimes translation patches may critically differ from the developer MD5 in memory differences that you may find online. Before linking these patches check with the original developer or do deep memory tests to ensure total compatibility.

You must apply a non-destructive hack to a copy of the original ROM file and release the IPS patch which includes the differences for people to be able to enjoy it.  Patching a ROM file with an IPS patcher is relatively easy.  A player enjoying ROM hacks for additional challenges is well-versed in the procedure.

Several games already special ROM hacking tool chains.  A lot of them are available here on github, but there's a plethora of them on ROMHacking.net that make the task easier.

It is your duty to do so as part of the \nRetroAchievements Developer Code of Conduct\n.\n\n\nStep 5\n - Link the MD5 to the new Bonus Set\nlink\n\n\nLoad it in an RA Emulator after approval, and follow the instructions for linking your new Bonus Set ROM to a new Achievement set on the website.  If your game produces an MD5 which collides with another game, you will have to make further edits to generate an MD5 which RetroAchievements loads as a new game.\n\n\nStep 6\n - Edit the new set's details page\nlink\n\n\nBrowse to your user page and your new game's page should be listed.  You can edit the game's details, screenshots, and information from the \nDev Options\n panel on the new set page.\n\n\nASK AN \nADMIN\n TO REVIEW YOUR WORK AFTER COMPLETING THIS STEP\n\n\nStep 7\n - Create achievements for the set, announce and release.\nlink\n\n\nYou can now begin developing achievements for your Bonus Set.  When you are finished, announce your Bonus Set and include the working IPS Patch in the forum thread for it after pushing them to Core.  Members currently need to apply the patch to their original game ROM as you have done in testing to play the Bonus Set.  \nYou are not permitted to release the patched Game ROM itself.

If you familiarize yourself with the quirks of your favorite console then set making will be easier and more accurate.\n\n\nNES (RANes)\nlink\n\n\nMemory Mirroring\nlink\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the memory inspector to find variables for NES games, there will be 4 copies of everything you find. If you're wondering \"which one do I use?\" or \"should I check for all of them?\" it's not as complicated as it seems.\n\n\nThis is a feature of the NES that gave developers more ways of looking at memory. Because the NES itself only has 2KB of RAM, the first result (the one below 0x800) should be used for consistency, and applying additional conditions on the others will do nothing.\n\n\nThis applies to RPS and leaderboards as well.\n\n\nGame Boy (RAVBA)\nlink\n\n\nMemory Map\nlink\n\n\nCertain ranges of values mean different things in the context of the Game Boy hardware, so having a map of what's where can help you with eliminating useless addresses. Here's the lowdown:\n\n\n\n\n\u274c \n0x0000 - 0x7FFF: ROM Data\n (No reason to use. This area contains header information that's only read on certain emulators.)\n\n\n\u274c \n0x8000 - 0x9FFF: Graphics Data\n (Some things here might correlate with what you're looking for if you're trying to find a map ID or animation, but there will always be a better way of going about what you're doing than using any of these)\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0f \n0xA000 - 0xBFFF: Cartridge RAM\n (IE. save data. Sometimes using these addresses will be unavoidable but then your set could be prone to cheating by loading 100% save files. More info on protecting against save files to come)\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0f \n0xC000 - 0xDFFF: Work RAM\n (The good stuff; almost everything you should use will fall inside this range)\n\n\n\u274c \n0xE000 - 0xFDFF: ECHO RAM\n (Do not use, see below)\n\n\n\u274c \n0xFE00 - 0xFE9F: More Graphics Data\n (same as Graphics Data above)\n\n\n\u274c \n0xFEA0 - 0xFFFF: Miscellaneous\n (Do not use)\n\n\n\n\nFor more info see: \nhttp://gameboy.mongenel.com/dmg/asmmemmap.html\n\n\nECHO RAM\nlink\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the NES, certain variables may show up twice when searching in the Memory Inspector. The second result is in what's called the ECHO RAM, which is a mirror of the actual memory. Since some emulators tend to ignore this area or emulate it incorrectly, it's recommended to NOT use it at all and always use the first result.\n\n\nThe Game Boy has 8KB of RAM starting at 0xC000. ECHO RAM starts at 0xE000, so if your address begins with an E you'll want to replace the first non-zero character with a C. Remember: C is correct, E is echo!\n\n\nGBC\nlink\n\n\nOn the GBC, the 4KB of memory from 0xD000-0xDFFF is a bank from a larger 32KB memory block not directly accessible by the processor. Bits 0-2 of 0xFF70 indicate which bank is loaded into the 0xD000-0xDFFF memory block. It's a \"feature\" used to expand the storage available to GBC ROMs while still supporting GB ROMs.\n\n\nBank switching (changing the value of 0xFF70) causes the memory in the 0xD000-0xDFFF range to update. This appears as flickering in the Memory Viewer and makes tracking down values in that memory range difficult. If you are writing conditions dependent on memory in that block, you should also require that 0xFF70 have a specific value to ensure you are looking at the correct bank. The 4KB of memory from 0xC000-0xCFFF is not bank-switched and can be used safely without additional conditions.\n\n\nIt is not advisable to use these addresses for achievements if there is any alternative to doing so. As of January 2018, RALibretro will only display bank 0x00 at 0xFF70. RetroArch has fluctuating memory banks, but the various addresses do not function in the same manner as RAVisualBoyAdvance. At least until RetroArch receives a memory inspector, achievements using addresses from 0xD000-0xDFFF will only work within RAVisualBoyAdvance.\n\n\nGB/GBC BIOS\nlink\n\n\nRALibRetro and RetroArch support the GB/GBC BIOS, which shows the \"Nintendo\" and \"GameBoy\" logo before starting the game. This provides approximately four seconds where the main memory ($C000-$DFFF) hasn't been initialized and can't be trusted, and may cause achievements to trigger while loading the game for a subset of users who have the BIOS enabled.\n\n\nTo enable this feature, put the bios file (named \ngb_bios.bin\n or \ngbc_bios.bin\n) into the system directory of either RALibRetro or RetroArch. When you start the game, you will see the \"Nintendo\" and \"GameBoy\" logos before proceeding into the actual game.\n\n\nIf this is causing you problems, you may need to add logic to prevent the achievements from triggering while the BIOS is executing, but it would be preferable to use in-game logic if possible (i.e. a specific screen is being displayed).\n\n\nThe BIOS code is loaded from $0000-$00FF, so identify some chunk of that memory that's unique while the BIOS is running and ignore it. For example, the last four bytes of the GBC BIOS block are \n3E 11 E0 50\n, so you could add this condition to the achievement to prevent it from triggering while the BIOS is running.\n\n\n32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0113E\n\n\n\n\nAfter the BIOS completes, the block is blanked out with FF's, and repurposed for interrupt vectors. For more detail, see \nA Look at the GameBoy bootstrap\n.\n\n\nNOTE\n: The last four bytes of the GB BIOS are \n3E 01 E0 50\n. So the GB condition would be:\n\n\n32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0013E\n\n\n\n\nNintendo 64 (RAP64)\nlink\n\n\nUsing GameShark Codes for Addresses\nlink\n\n\nGameShark codes can be a valuable resource for finding addresses you can't or don't feel like finding. They have 12 characters per line and are fairly easy to parse.\n\n\n[AA][BBBBBB] [CCCC]\n\n\n[AA] is the codetype. This is a short instruction to the GameShark that defines what to do with the next value. If you understand what the GameShark code does you can use it to help with condition-making.\n\n\n\n\n80, 88:\n The address is 8-bit. Sets the value [00CC] to the address [BBBBBB].\n\n\n81, 89:\n The address is 16-bit. Sets the value [CCCC] to the address [BBBBBB].\n\n\nD0:\n The address is 8-bit. Checks if [00CC] is equal to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.\n\n\nD2:\n The address is 8-bit. Checks if [00CC] is DIFFERENT to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.\n\n\nD1:\n The address is 16-bit. Checks if [CCCC] is equal to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.\n\n\nD3:\n The address is 16-bit. Checks if [CCCC] is DIFFERENT to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples:\n* Paper Mario: Infinite HP:\n\n\n[80][10F292] [0032]\n\n\nSets the 8-bit value at 0x10F292 to 0x32 (50). So this means Mario's HP is an 8-bit value at 0x10F292.\n\n\n\n\nDonkey Kong 64: Play as Rambi: \n\n\n\n\n[80][74E77C] [0006]\n\n\nSets the 8-bit value at 0x74E77C to 6. So this means the character you're playing as is an 8-bit value at 0x74E77C.\n\n\n\n\nChameleon Twist 2: Hold L to Moon Jump:\n\n\n\n\n[D0][18BAB5] [0020] <- Looking at this one\n\n\n[81][18B9E0] [4200]\n\n\nChecks if the 8-bit value at 0x18BAB5 is equal to 0x20. This means 0x18BAB5 contains a button press variable and Bit5 (0x20) corresponds to L.\n\n\nAnti-GSC\n and \nGameHacking\n are both good resources for finding GameShark codes.\n\n\nNeo Geo\nlink\n\n\nMandatory UniBIOS protection\nlink\n\n\nUniBIOS allows several debugging options, and also access the database of individual cheats for every game. Therefore all achievements for Neo Geo need to be protected from abusing it. The simpliest solution here is disallowing UniBIOS usage completely, directly from the level of achievement code.\n\n\nFortunately part of UniBIOS data seems to be reflected in two address strings in the RAM: \n0x00fe30\n and \n0x00fe50\n.

This area contains header information that's only read on certain emulators.)  \u274c  0x8000 - 0x9FFF: Graphics Data  (Some things here might correlate with what you're looking for if you're trying to find a map ID or animation, but there will always be a better way of going about what you're doing than using any of these)  \u2714\ufe0f  0xA000 - 0xBFFF: Cartridge RAM  (IE. save data. Sometimes using these addresses will be unavoidable but then your set could be prone to cheating by loading 100% save files. More info on protecting against save files to come)  \u2714\ufe0f  0xC000 - 0xDFFF: Work RAM  (The good stuff; almost everything you should use will fall inside this range)  \u274c  0xE000 - 0xFDFF: ECHO RAM  (Do not use, see below)  \u274c  0xFE00 - 0xFE9F: More Graphics Data  (same as Graphics Data above)  \u274c  0xFEA0 - 0xFFFF: Miscellaneous  (Do not use)   For more info see:  http://gameboy.mongenel.com/dmg/asmmemmap.html",

Since some emulators tend to ignore this area or emulate it incorrectly, it's recommended to NOT use it at all and always use the first result.  The Game Boy has 8KB of RAM starting at 0xC000.

Bits 0-2 of 0xFF70 indicate which bank is loaded into the 0xD000-0xDFFF memory block. It's a \"feature\" used to expand the storage available to GBC ROMs while still supporting GB ROMs.  Bank switching (changing the value of 0xFF70) causes the memory in the 0xD000-0xDFFF range to update. This appears as flickering in the Memory Viewer and makes tracking down values in that memory range difficult. If you are writing conditions dependent on memory in that block, you should also require that 0xFF70 have a specific value to ensure you are looking at the correct bank. The 4KB of memory from 0xC000-0xCFFF is not bank-switched and can be used safely without additional conditions.  It is not advisable to use these addresses for achievements if there is any alternative to doing so. As of January 2018, RALibretro will only display bank 0x00 at 0xFF70. RetroArch has fluctuating memory banks, but the various addresses do not function in the same manner as RAVisualBoyAdvance. At least until RetroArch receives a memory inspector, achievements using addresses from 0xD000-0xDFFF will only work within RAVisualBoyAdvance.",

This provides approximately four seconds where the main memory ($C000-$DFFF) hasn't been initialized and can't be trusted, and may cause achievements to trigger while loading the game for a subset of users who have the BIOS enabled.  To enable this feature, put the bios file (named  gb_bios.bin  or  gbc_bios.bin ) into the system directory of either RALibRetro or RetroArch. When you start the game, you will see the \"Nintendo\" and \"GameBoy\" logos before proceeding into the actual game.  If this is causing you problems, you may need to add logic to prevent the achievements from triggering while the BIOS is executing, but it would be preferable to use in-game logic if possible (i.e. a specific screen is being displayed).  The BIOS code is loaded from $0000-$00FF, so identify some chunk of that memory that's unique while the BIOS is running and ignore it. For example, the last four bytes of the GBC BIOS block are  3E 11 E0 50 , so you could add this condition to the achievement to prevent it from triggering while the BIOS is running.  32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0113E  After the BIOS completes, the block is blanked out with FF's, and repurposed for interrupt vectors. For more detail, see  A Look at the GameBoy bootstrap .  NOTE : The last four bytes of the GB BIOS are  3E 01 E0 50 . So the GB condition would be:  32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0013E",

[AA][BBBBBB] [CCCC]  [AA] is the codetype. This is a short instruction to the GameShark that defines what to do with the next value. If you understand what the GameShark code does you can use it to help with condition-making.   80, 88:  The address is 8-bit. Sets the value [00CC] to the address [BBBBBB].  81, 89:  The address is 16-bit. Sets the value [CCCC] to the address [BBBBBB].  D0:  The address is 8-bit. Checks if [00CC] is equal to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.  D2:  The address is 8-bit. Checks if [00CC] is DIFFERENT to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.  D1:  The address is 16-bit. Checks if [CCCC] is equal to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.  D3:  The address is 16-bit. Checks if [CCCC] is DIFFERENT to the value at address [BBBBBB] then executes the next line if it is.   Here are some examples:\n* Paper Mario: Infinite HP:  [80][10F292] [0032]  Sets the 8-bit value at 0x10F292 to 0x32 (50). So this means Mario's HP is an 8-bit value at 0x10F292.   Donkey Kong 64: Play as Rambi:    [80][74E77C] [0006]  Sets the 8-bit value at 0x74E77C to 6. So this means the character you're playing as is an 8-bit value at 0x74E77C.   Chameleon Twist 2: Hold L to Moon Jump:   [D0][18BAB5] [0020] <- Looking at this one  [81][18B9E0] [4200]  Checks if the 8-bit value at 0x18BAB5 is equal to 0x20. This means 0x18BAB5 contains a button press variable and Bit5 (0x20) corresponds to L.  Anti-GSC  and  GameHacking  are both good resources for finding GameShark codes.",

Todas as conquistas s\u00e3o criadas e mantidas pela pr\u00f3pria comunidade e s\u00e3o presenteadas para os usu\u00e1rios atrav\u00e9s de emuladores especialmente customizados e disponibilizados em nossa p\u00e1gina. Uma vez logado em nossos emuladores, os programas ir\u00e3o informar \u00e0 central todas as conquistas que voc\u00ea conquistou para que voc\u00ea possa checar e comparar o seu progresso com o de seus amigos atrav\u00e9s do site.\n\n\nNo exemplo a seguir, \nRAGens\n (nossa vers\u00e3o personalizada do emulador Gens do Mega Drive) est\u00e1 emulando o jogo \nStreets of Rage 2\n. Dois \nleaderboards\n especiais podem ser notados no canto inferior direito da tela (eles ir\u00e3o coletar informa\u00e7\u00f5es especiais como a pontua\u00e7\u00e3o, por exemplo). Ao completar uma s\u00e9rie de requisitos, uma conquista \u00e9 desbloqueada pelo jogador que \u00e9 informado sobre o evento atrav\u00e9s de um \"pop-up\" especial. Ao final do exemplo, um menu especial com v\u00e1rias informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o jogo (que pode ser ativado ao pressionar a tecla ESC) aparece na tela.\n\n\n\n\nO que \u00e9 o modo HARDCORE?\nlink\n\n\nO modo HARDCORE \u00e9 um recurso adicional que separa os bons jogadores dos grandes jogadores! Ao habilitar esse modo, voc\u00ea ficar\u00e1 impossibilitado de carregar um arquivo de \"savestate\" previamente salvo, ou seja: o jogo n\u00e3o mais poder\u00e1 ser salvo e carregado a qualquer momento. Ao habilitar o modo HARDCORE, voc\u00ea dever\u00e1 completar o jogo assim como ele foi projetado em seu console original e ganhar as suas conquistas sem a ajuda de recursos extras. Como recompensa, toda vez que habilitar uma conquista nesse modo, duas vers\u00f5es da mesma conquista ser\u00e3o presenteadas: a sua vers\u00e3o normal (ou SOFTCORE) e a sua vers\u00e3o HARDCORE, cada uma delas somando a mesma quantidade de pontos ao seu placar totalizando o dobro de pontos que iriam ser ganhos com o modo HARDCORE desabilitado. Um jogo com um total de 400 pontos poder\u00e1 lhe conferir 800 pontos caso voc\u00ea ganhe todas as conquistas dispon\u00edveis no modo HARCORE!\n\n\nNota\n: Ao jogar no modo \"SOFTCORE\" e usar as op\u00e7\u00f5es de \"savestate\" para salvar e carregar o seu jogo a qualquer momento, comportamentos inesperados por parte das conquistas poder\u00e3o ser observados.

Quando todas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es para uma conquista particular s\u00e3o atendidas, esta conquista \u00e9 ativada e o emulador deixa de verificar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es para essa conquista.\n\n\nO processo de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma conquista envolve basicamente 3 etapas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncontrar um lugar na RAM do jogo onde a informa\u00e7\u00e3o que voc\u00ea deseja \u00e9 armazenada (exemplos: n\u00edvel, barra de vida, tempo, moedas, segurando uma arma, obter um item, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriar condi\u00e7\u00f5es que devem ser cumpridas para ativar uma conquista.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestar se a sua conquista est\u00e1 funcionando como esperado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvavelmente voc\u00ea voltar\u00e1 para os passos 2 e 3 muitas vezes para refinar a l\u00f3gica de sua conquista.\n\n\nNeste documento, veremos como realizar as etapas acima.\n\n\nDepois de ter certeza de que sua conquista est\u00e1 funcionando nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es desejadas, voc\u00ea pode envi\u00e1-la para o servidor. Veremos mais sobre isso adiante.\n\n\nPrimeiros passos\nlink\n\n\nAntes de come\u00e7ar, certifique-se de ter um emulador RA da p\u00e1gina do \nRetroAchievements Download Page\n primeiro e crie uma conta para que voc\u00ea possa fazer login usando o emulador.\n\n\nNeste guia, estaremos usando RAGens para demonstrar, e o jogo  \nSonic the Hedgehog\n. Estamos usando RAGens, mas o mesmo se aplica aos outros emuladores.\n\n\nPara come\u00e7ar, execute o RAGens e fa\u00e7a o login quando solicitado. Em seguida, use File -> Open e selecione qualquer ROM que voc\u00ea deseja encontrar conquistas.\n\n\nMemory Inspector\nlink\n\n\nAgora voc\u00ea deve ter sua janela principal executando o Sonic. Existem 3 outros di\u00e1logos que usaremos, que podem ser encontrados em RetroAchievements no menu. Em primeiro lugar, tratamos primeiro o Memory Inspector:\n\n\n\n\nO Memory Inspector pode ser usado para encontrar endere\u00e7os na RAM para que possamos usar. Essencialmente, voc\u00ea est\u00e1 em uma ca\u00e7ada ao tesouro para locais de mem\u00f3ria - este di\u00e1logo ir\u00e1 ajud\u00e1-lo a examinar e filtrar a RAM do jogo enquanto o jogo est\u00e1 sendo executado.\n\n\nNOTA: Se voc\u00ea quer uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o passo a passo de v\u00eddeo para encontrar endere\u00e7os de mem\u00f3ria, \neste video\n esse v\u00eddeo pode ser muito \u00fatil\n. \nV\u00eddeo em ingl\u00eas\n\n\nPara iniciar ou reiniciar um teste, clique em \nNew 8-bit Test\n  perto do meio na parte superior.\n\n\nPara manter as coisas simples, come\u00e7aremos procurando pelo endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria que contenha o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is que coletamos. Nossas etapas ser\u00e3o as seguintes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarregue a ROM e comece um novo jogo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedefinir a caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria: clique em \nNew 8-bit Test\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetorne ao jogo e altere o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is na mem\u00f3ria. Por exemplo, colete um anel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNa caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria, agora queremos filtrar por valores que sejam \"maiores do que valores anteriores\" (s\u00edmbolo>). Selecionamos isso, ent\u00e3o, clique em \nFilter\n.\n\n\nCada vez que voc\u00ea executa 3 e 4, o n\u00famero de possibilidades ou 'candidatos' diminuir\u00e1. Continuaremos a faz\u00ea-lo at\u00e9 que o n\u00famero de candidatos alcance um n\u00famero muito pequeno (o menor poss\u00edvel), pode demorar 4-5 tentativas. Em seguida, podemos clicar na janela de resultados e monitorar o endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria no visor de mem\u00f3ria na parte inferior. Continue usando o jogo e voc\u00ea deve ver os valores em mudan\u00e7a de mem\u00f3ria \u00e0 medida que voc\u00ea coleciona an\u00e9is. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o, ou se algo n\u00e3o parece direito, tente outro valor. Com o primeiro Sonic the Hedgehog, o endere\u00e7o da mem\u00f3ria para o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is deve ser 0xfe20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNota\n: Usando estados de salvamento (F5 para salvar o estado, F8 para carregar o estado, F6-F7 para alternar o estado a ser usado), voc\u00ea pode alternar entre estados diferentes, permitindo alterar o que est\u00e1 na RAM e usar isso para filtrar fora candidatos ruins. Voc\u00ea pode procurar por valores que permanecem os mesmos (ou seja, se voc\u00ea sabe que o valor n\u00e3o mudou, use =) ou valores diferentes (use 'not equal', symbol! =).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNota\n: Infelizmente nenhuma garantia de jogo para jogo sobre como os desenvolvedores armazenaram seus dados (decimais de codigo bin\u00e1rio de 4 bits, 8 bits, 16 bits, negativos / invertidos, ou seja, usando 0xff / 0xffff para representar 'set' , ou simples, aleatoriamente), mas, eventualmente, voc\u00ea deve encontrar um bom endere\u00e7o. Observe se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 lutando para encontrar bons valores, postar o f\u00f3rum de Ajuda de desenvolvimento \nRetroAchievements.org Development Help forum \nou o servidor \n RetroAchievements Discord server\n. H\u00e1 muitas pessoas que ficar\u00e3o muito felizes em ajudar!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDica\n: se voc\u00ea quiser experimentar a mem\u00f3ria, tente inserir novos valores diretamente no visualizador de RAM. Isso pode ter efeitos devastadores no jogo, ou pode fazer exatamente o que voc\u00ea espera, (ou nada!) Pode ser \u00fatil, para ver se voc\u00ea pode inserir um valor e obter o resultado esperado. Use com cuidado!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuando voc\u00ea encontrou um endere\u00e7o com o qual voc\u00ea est\u00e1 feliz, voc\u00ea pode escrever uma nota curta para o que \u00e9 e clicar em Salvar nota, isso ir\u00e1 armazen\u00e1-lo no banco de dados e ser\u00e1 restaurado automaticamente na pr\u00f3xima vez que voc\u00ea carregar o visor de mem\u00f3ria para isso jogo onde quer que esteja! Note que depois de clicar em \"Salvar nota\", a nota ser\u00e1 armazenada automaticamente no banco de dados, e compartilhada para que todos os desenvolvedores compartilhem o acesso a essas notas de mem\u00f3ria. Todos ser\u00e3o baixados de novo quando voc\u00ea carregar uma ROM. Se voc\u00ea tentar substituir uma nota, verificar\u00e1 com voc\u00ea primeiro antes de enviar.\n\n\nVoc\u00ea pode encontrar \nDicas de Escava\u00e7\u00e3o de Mem\u00f3ria aqui\n.\n\n\nAchievement Sets\nlink\n\n\nOK para que a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o da mem\u00f3ria para o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is seja armazenada em \n0xfe20\n - nota para um n\u00e3o programador, estamos lidando com um \nsistema de numera\u00e7\u00e3o hexadecimal\n que pode ser assustador, mas n\u00e3o se preocupe, essencialmente s\u00e3o apenas n\u00fameros e letras em vez de apenas n\u00fameros, e n\u00e3o esquecendo \n0x\n no in\u00edcio para mostrar que \u00e9 uma localiza\u00e7\u00e3o de mem\u00f3ria em hexadecimal. Encontramos um endere\u00e7o em que nos interessamos e armazenamos usando \nSave Note\n. Agora queremos criar uma nova conquista.\n\n\nV\u00e1 para o \nRetroAchievements\n no menu, escolha \nAchievement Sets\n e voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 esta caixa de di\u00e1logo:\n\n\n\n\nAqui agrupamos todas as conquistas que conhecemos em tr\u00eas conjuntos:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Achievements (o principal, conjunto de conquistas p\u00fablico),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnofficial/User Achievements (p\u00fablico, mas n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 premiar pontos, \u00e9 apenas para outros desenvolvedores revisarem),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Achievements (pessoais no seu PC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNa caixa de di\u00e1logo Conquistas, clique em \nLocal Achievements\n (canto superior esquerdo), depois em \nAdd New Achievement\n (inferior esquerda). Isso ir\u00e1 adicionar uma entrada em branco \u00e0 lista no centro. Clique duas vezes nele: se ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 aberto, isso deve selecion\u00e1-lo e abrir a caixa de di\u00e1logo Editor de conquista (\nAchievement Editor\n).\n\n\nAchievement Editor\nlink\n\n\nO Achievement Editor se parece com isso:\n\n\n\n\nEsta \u00e9 a \u00faltima caixa de di\u00e1logo onde reunimos todos os dados juntos. A maioria dos principais campos s\u00e3o auto-explicativos, ou seja, Title, Description, Points. A principal \u00e9 a parte de 'Requirements' (Requisitos).\n\n\nDigamos que queremos adicionar uma conquista para colecionar um certo n\u00famero de an\u00e9is. Digamos 15 an\u00e9is para simplificar. Depois de preencher os campos na parte superior e selecionar um \u00edcone adequado (neste exemplo, usamos o distintivo de trof\u00e9u de ouro (00136), mas voc\u00ea pode carregar um novo), precisamos preencher os Requisitos. Temos um requisito, \nque o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is \u00e9 pelo menos 15\n. O pr\u00f3ximo clique \u00e9 \nAdd New Requirement\n.\n\n\nAo clicar neste bot\u00e3o, ser\u00e3o adicionados v\u00e1rios valores padr\u00e3o \u00e0 lista Requisitos. Esses padr\u00f5es apenas garantem que algo relativamente sens\u00edvel seja adicionado \u00e0 lista. Por enquanto, ignorando o campo 'Special?'. Quando clicamos em criar, o valor de mem\u00f3ria padr\u00e3o ser\u00e1 o valor que voc\u00ea deixou pela \u00faltima vez na caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria.\n\n\nEm seguida, alteraremos esses valores para o seguinte:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n: \n16 bits\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory\n: \n0xfe20\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCmp:\n \n>=\n - esta \u00e9 a compara\u00e7\u00e3o a fazer. Podemos ter alguma compara\u00e7\u00e3o aqui, mas \u00e9 sensato ter \"maior ou igual\". Isso \u00e9 importante porque, se conseguimos 10 an\u00e9is, ent\u00e3o uma caixa de super anel para ter 20, perder\u00edamos exatamente 15 an\u00e9is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n: \nValue\n - estamos comparando esse valor de mem\u00f3ria com um valor fixo: 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n: \nEmpty\n - isso s\u00f3 \u00e9 relevante ao comparar a mem\u00f3ria com a mem\u00f3ria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMem/Val\n: \n15\n - o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is necess\u00e1rios: o valor com o qual estamos comparando a mem\u00f3ria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Count\n: \n0\n - ignore isso por enquanto, \u00e9 \u00fatil para quando algo precisa acontecer um certo n\u00famero de vezes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCom esse conjunto, n\u00e3o temos mais condi\u00e7\u00f5es para adicionar, ent\u00e3o retornamos \u00e0 caixa de di\u00e1logo \nAchievements\n. Para estar seguro, devemos salvar nosso progresso ao clicar em \nSave Local\n! Isso salva tudo para arquivar localmente para garantir que n\u00e3o perderemos nenhum progresso.\n\n\n\n\nNota\n: geralmente as conquistas t\u00eam mais de um requisito para evitar que ele acione em um momento errado (ou seja, jogando o modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o). Neste exemplo, estamos usando apenas um requisito apenas para simplificar a explica\u00e7\u00e3o. Veja mais dicas de \nAchievement Creation Tips here\n.\n\n\n\n\nTestando a conquista\nlink\n\n\nAgora podemos \"ativar\" essa conquista localmente ao clicar \nActivate\n no lado direito. Isso come\u00e7ar\u00e1 a monitorar esses locais de mem\u00f3ria e atribuir\u00e1 a conquista uma vez que todas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o verdadeiras. Agora, podemos prosseguir e testar para ver se essa conquista funciona!\n\n\n\n\nSe pressionarmos no jogo Esc, voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 a conquista aparecer como uma demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o do que seria semelhante \u00e0 sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o no jogo!\n\n\n\n\nEvitando bugs\nlink\n\n\nO cheevo (\nachievement\n) que criamos neste tutorial \u00e9 muito simples, tem apenas uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o: \"an\u00e9is coletados\" >= 15 \". Mas o endere\u00e7o para gravar o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is coletados tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 usado quando o jogo \u00e9 executado em \"modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o\" (AI jogando o jogo depois de esperar um pouco na tela de t\u00edtulo). Ent\u00e3o, se Sonic coletar 15 an\u00e9is no modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o, essa conquista ir\u00e1 desencadear, o que \u00e9 indesej\u00e1vel.\n\n\nEnt\u00e3o, aqui est\u00e3o algumas dicas que voc\u00ea sempre deve ter em mente ao criar suas conquistas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNunca use/Evite ao m\u00e1ximo usar apenas uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o\n. Caso contr\u00e1rio, a conquista provavelmente ir\u00e1 aparecer na hora errada. Este \u00e9 o erro mais comum cometido por um desenvolvedor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \nPauseIf\n demo mode (modo demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o)\n: Se o jogo tiver um modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o, certifique-se de encontrar o endere\u00e7o para ele e adicionar o modo! = Demo ou algo semelhante em suas conquistas. Mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre PauseIf na p\u00e1gina Caracter\u00edsticas da l\u00f3gica de conquista.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \nPauseIf\n usando macetes (cheat codes)\n: se o jogo tiver um c\u00f3digo secreto de macete para aumentar vidas, selecionar fases, etc. Certifique-se de encontrar os endere\u00e7os para isso e adicionar algum tipo de prote\u00e7\u00e3o em suas conquistas. OK, talvez n\u00e3o seja um t\u00f3pico muito b\u00e1sico, mas voc\u00ea deve ter em mente ao criar um conjunto de conquistas real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, o achievement funciona. E agora?\nlink\n\n\nDepois de testarmos que a conquista funciona localmente, h\u00e1 um processo de confirma\u00e7\u00e3o em duas etapas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimeiro, na caixa de di\u00e1logo Conquistas, selecionamos nossa conquista e pressione \nCommit Selected\n e concordamos com a caixa de di\u00e1logo. Isso ir\u00e1 empurrar nossa conquista para o servidor e armazen\u00e1-lo em \nUnofficial User-submitted Achievements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPara que a conquista seja apreciada por muitos, ela deve ser empurrada para o conjunto Core Achievement (\nCore Achievement set\n). Para as suas poucas primeiras conquistas, ele deve ser revisado por um membro da equipe antes que possa ser empurrado para o Core. Depois de ter carregado um conjunto de conquistas para o Unofficial, voc\u00ea precisa entrar em contato com um administrador que, usando seu julgamento e padr\u00f5es pessoais de qualidade, aprovar\u00e1 o conjunto e lhe dar\u00e1 um status de desenvolvedor no site (\nDeveloper status\n). Nesse caso, voc\u00ea pode empurrar qualquer conquista para o Core voc\u00ea mesmo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturalmente, \u00e9 melhor enviar apenas conquistas \u00fanicas e interessantes no grupo de conquistas principais. Se houver duplicatas no grupo Core, as duplicatas adicionadas mais recentemente ser\u00e3o manualmente moderadas e exclu\u00eddas. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o quer sua conquista no grupo Core, ou voc\u00ea acha que pode n\u00e3o ser apropriado para o grupo Core (ou seja, se est\u00e1 incompleto, ou se \u00e0s vezes ele parece se desencadear quando n\u00e3o \u00e9 suposto, como quando o jogo est\u00e1 mostrando um demo), deixe-o na se\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00e3o oficial / Se\u00e7\u00e3o submetida pelo usu\u00e1rio.\n\n\nPr\u00f3ximos passos\nlink\n\n\nAgora que voc\u00ea sabe como usar o Memory Inspector e o Editor de Conquistas. \u00c9 hora de aprender novas t\u00e9cnicas e pr\u00e1ticas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPara refinar a l\u00f3gica de sua conquista, voc\u00ea pode ver quais recursos voc\u00ea possui na p\u00e1gina \nAchievement Logic Features\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoc\u00ea pode aprender observando as conquistas existentes que outros desenvolvedores fizeram com uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o extra na p\u00e1gina \nReal Examples\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m pode ver alguns exemplos gen\u00e9ricos na p\u00e1gina \nAchievement Templates\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiverta-se!

Quando voc\u00ea inicia um jogo em um emulador com o recurso RetroAchievements, o emulador sempre verifica se essas condi\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o atendidas no  frame  atual. Quando todas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es para uma conquista particular s\u00e3o atendidas, esta conquista \u00e9 ativada e o emulador deixa de verificar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es para essa conquista.  O processo de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma conquista envolve basicamente 3 etapas:    Encontrar um lugar na RAM do jogo onde a informa\u00e7\u00e3o que voc\u00ea deseja \u00e9 armazenada (exemplos: n\u00edvel, barra de vida, tempo, moedas, segurando uma arma, obter um item, etc.).    Criar condi\u00e7\u00f5es que devem ser cumpridas para ativar uma conquista.    Testar se a sua conquista est\u00e1 funcionando como esperado.    Provavelmente voc\u00ea voltar\u00e1 para os passos 2 e 3 muitas vezes para refinar a l\u00f3gica de sua conquista.  Neste documento, veremos como realizar as etapas acima.  Depois de ter certeza de que sua conquista est\u00e1 funcionando nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es desejadas, voc\u00ea pode envi\u00e1-la para o servidor. Veremos mais sobre isso adiante.",

Em primeiro lugar, tratamos primeiro o Memory Inspector:   O Memory Inspector pode ser usado para encontrar endere\u00e7os na RAM para que possamos usar. Essencialmente, voc\u00ea est\u00e1 em uma ca\u00e7ada ao tesouro para locais de mem\u00f3ria - este di\u00e1logo ir\u00e1 ajud\u00e1-lo a examinar e filtrar a RAM do jogo enquanto o jogo est\u00e1 sendo executado.  NOTA: Se voc\u00ea quer uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o passo a passo de v\u00eddeo para encontrar endere\u00e7os de mem\u00f3ria,  este video  esse v\u00eddeo pode ser muito \u00fatil .  V\u00eddeo em ingl\u00eas  Para iniciar ou reiniciar um teste, clique em  New 8-bit Test   perto do meio na parte superior.  Para manter as coisas simples, come\u00e7aremos procurando pelo endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria que contenha o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is que coletamos. Nossas etapas ser\u00e3o as seguintes:    Carregue a ROM e comece um novo jogo.    Redefinir a caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria: clique em  New 8-bit Test .    Retorne ao jogo e altere o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is na mem\u00f3ria. Por exemplo, colete um anel.    Na caixa de di\u00e1logo de mem\u00f3ria, agora queremos filtrar por valores que sejam \"maiores do que valores anteriores\" (s\u00edmbolo>). Selecionamos isso, ent\u00e3o, clique em  Filter .  Cada vez que voc\u00ea executa 3 e 4, o n\u00famero de possibilidades ou 'candidatos' diminuir\u00e1. Continuaremos a faz\u00ea-lo at\u00e9 que o n\u00famero de candidatos alcance um n\u00famero muito pequeno (o menor poss\u00edvel), pode demorar 4-5 tentativas. Em seguida, podemos clicar na janela de resultados e monitorar o endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria no visor de mem\u00f3ria na parte inferior. Continue usando o jogo e voc\u00ea deve ver os valores em mudan\u00e7a de mem\u00f3ria \u00e0 medida que voc\u00ea coleciona an\u00e9is. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o, ou se algo n\u00e3o parece direito, tente outro valor. Com o primeiro Sonic the Hedgehog, o endere\u00e7o da mem\u00f3ria para o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is deve ser 0xfe20.    Nota : Usando estados de salvamento (F5 para salvar o estado, F8 para carregar o estado, F6-F7 para alternar o estado a ser usado), voc\u00ea pode alternar entre estados diferentes, permitindo alterar o que est\u00e1 na RAM e usar isso para filtrar fora candidatos ruins. Voc\u00ea pode procurar por valores que permanecem os mesmos (ou seja, se voc\u00ea sabe que o valor n\u00e3o mudou, use =) ou valores diferentes (use 'not equal', symbol! =).    Nota : Infelizmente nenhuma garantia de jogo para jogo sobre como os desenvolvedores armazenaram seus dados (decimais de codigo bin\u00e1rio de 4 bits, 8 bits, 16 bits, negativos / invertidos, ou seja, usando 0xff / 0xffff para representar 'set' , ou simples, aleatoriamente), mas, eventualmente, voc\u00ea deve encontrar um bom endere\u00e7o. Observe se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 lutando para encontrar bons valores, postar o f\u00f3rum de Ajuda de desenvolvimento  RetroAchievements.org Development Help forum  ou o servidor   RetroAchievements Discord server . H\u00e1 muitas pessoas que ficar\u00e3o muito felizes em ajudar!    Dica : se voc\u00ea quiser experimentar a mem\u00f3ria, tente inserir novos valores diretamente no visualizador de RAM. Isso pode ter efeitos devastadores no jogo, ou pode fazer exatamente o que voc\u00ea espera, (ou nada!) Pode ser \u00fatil, para ver se voc\u00ea pode inserir um valor e obter o resultado esperado. Use com cuidado!    Quando voc\u00ea encontrou um endere\u00e7o com o qual voc\u00ea est\u00e1 feliz, voc\u00ea pode escrever uma nota curta para o que \u00e9 e clicar em Salvar nota, isso ir\u00e1 armazen\u00e1-lo no banco de dados e ser\u00e1 restaurado automaticamente na pr\u00f3xima vez que voc\u00ea carregar o visor de mem\u00f3ria para isso jogo onde quer que esteja! Note que depois de clicar em \"Salvar nota\", a nota ser\u00e1 armazenada automaticamente no banco de dados, e compartilhada para que todos os desenvolvedores compartilhem o acesso a essas notas de mem\u00f3ria. Todos ser\u00e3o baixados de novo quando voc\u00ea carregar uma ROM. Se voc\u00ea tentar substituir uma nota, verificar\u00e1 com voc\u00ea primeiro antes de enviar.

Mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre PauseIf na p\u00e1gina Caracter\u00edsticas da l\u00f3gica de conquista.    Use  PauseIf  usando macetes (cheat codes) : se o jogo tiver um c\u00f3digo secreto de macete para aumentar vidas, selecionar fases, etc. Certifique-se de encontrar os endere\u00e7os para isso e adicionar algum tipo de prote\u00e7\u00e3o em suas conquistas.

E .: Mac OSX, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android e navegador).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreocupe-se com a gram\u00e1tica\n: evite erros de gram\u00e1tica. Como o RetroAchievements \u00e9 uma comunidade internacional, usar o ingl\u00eas para Code Notes \u00e9 uma boa pr\u00e1tica, pois outro desenvolvedor pode usar suas anota\u00e7\u00f5es no futuro. Se o ingl\u00eas n\u00e3o for o seu primeiro idioma, passar seus t\u00edtulos, nomes e notas de c\u00f3digo atrav\u00e9s de um corretor ortogr\u00e1fico ajudar\u00e1. \u00c9 um passo extra para aqueles que t\u00eam dificuldade com a l\u00edngua inglesa, mas o cuidado e a aten\u00e7\u00e3o refletem nas suas qualidades positivas como desenvolvedor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDicas de sele\u00e7\u00e3o de ROM\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSele\u00e7\u00e3o de regi\u00e3o\n: Escolha as ROM lan\u00e7adas como \nNTSC USA\n se dispon\u00edveis, pois 60 FPS (\nF\nrames \nP\ner \nS\necond) \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia de jogo mais suave. As ROMs lan\u00e7adas como \nPAL European\n s\u00e3o executados em 50 FPS, e devem ser evitados na maioria dos casos. As ROMs lan\u00e7adas como \nNTSC Japan\n tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o executados em 60 FPS, mas s\u00f3 \u00e9 a melhor op\u00e7\u00e3o se o jogo for uma vers\u00e3o exclusiva do Jap\u00e3o. Recorrer a um jogo lan\u00e7ado como \nPAL European\n deve ser apenas em \u00faltimo caso (exclusivo para a Europa) e normalmente \u00e9 um n\u00famero muito seleto de jogos \n\u00fanicos\n da biblioteca inteira do console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSem Mods\n: N\u00e3o use uma ROM com uma tela de inicializa\u00e7\u00e3o modificada / personalizada, como Mode7 e RisingSun, porque ela bagun\u00e7a a RAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSem *trainers\n*: N\u00e3o use uma ROM que inclua um recurso cheat integrado. Elas s\u00e3o frequentemente referidas com \"ROM trainers\". Elas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o oficiais e, de forma alguma s\u00e3o suportados pelo RetroAchievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDicas de escava\u00e7\u00e3o de mem\u00f3ria\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoc\u00ea pode inserir valores no Memory Inspector para ver se ele afeta algo no jogo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe voc\u00ea encontrar um endere\u00e7o, procure tamb\u00e9m a mesma regi\u00e3o que o rodeia e voc\u00ea pode encontrar muitos outros endere\u00e7os \u00fateis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesmo que algo esteja visivelmente decrescente no jogo, como a sa\u00fade, o valor n\u00e3o est\u00e1 necessariamente diminuindo. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel que ele esteja aumentando, ent\u00e3o, como \u00e9 incomum para voc\u00ea saber com certeza, voc\u00ea deve apenas filtrar \n!=\n E \n==\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe voc\u00ea absolutamente n\u00e3o consegue reduzir os resultados de um filtro, voc\u00ea pode tentar adivinhar alguns valores ou pelo menos como o valor est\u00e1 atuando (\n>\n ou \n<\n). Por exemplo, geralmente nenhuma barra de energia \u00e9 \n0\n, o est\u00e1gio 1 geralmente \u00e9 o valor \n0\n, o est\u00e1gio 2 geralmente \u00e9 o valor \n1\n, dependendo do tipo de jogo. Outro exemplo, talvez cada segmento da sua energia tenha 4 barrinhas - Voc\u00ea deve procurar quando \"4\" vai para \"3\" quando voc\u00ea perde uma barrinha?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDicas por n\u00edvel de habilidade\nlink\n\n\nN\u00edvel 1 - F\u00e1cil\nlink\n\n\nComece com a visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de 8 bits no Memory Inspector. Olhar para grandes partes de mem\u00f3ria ir\u00e1 complicar as coisas, mas isso facilitar\u00e1 o trabalho de um desenvolvedor experiente. Se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 apenas come\u00e7ando e desconhece termos como \nendianess\n e \nbit ordering\n (ou quando o cansa\u00e7o bate), \u00e9 melhor fazer suas observa\u00e7\u00f5es na vis\u00e3o de 8 bits. \u00c9 mais f\u00e1cil!\n\n\nN\u00edvel 2 - M\u00e9dio\nlink\n\n\nBig data (vista de 16 ou 32 bits): lembre-se de que ao adicionar um endere\u00e7o de 16 bits o endere\u00e7o \u00e0 direita vem primeiro.\n\n\nExemplo: \nAB CD WX YZ\n em 8 bits torna-se\nCDAB YZWX\n em 16 bits.\n\n\nIsso \u00e9 chamado de \"ordena\u00e7\u00e3o de bytes big endian\". Voc\u00ea pode tranquilamente ignorar esse papo geek apenas lembrando que as coisas est\u00e3o armazenadas \"de tr\u00e1s pra frente\" na vista de 16 bits e acima.\n\n\nLembre-se de que se voc\u00ea estiver vendo mem\u00f3ria em peda\u00e7os maiores, quando voc\u00ea destaca um valor, esse valor agora representa um \"peda\u00e7o\" de mem\u00f3ria de 16 ou 32 bits e n\u00e3o o endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria de 8 bits que voc\u00ea pode estar procurando. Voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 voltar para a vis\u00e3o de 8 bits e destacar a endere\u00e7o que te interessa, se voc\u00ea encontrar algo de 8 bits que pare\u00e7a interessante.\n\n\nN\u00edvel 3 - Avan\u00e7ado\nlink\n\n\nAdicionando suporte para os cores libretro Little Endian: N64-specific, na maioria das vezes, ao adicionar suporte para um core libretro LE ao seu set, os conceitos explicados anteriormente (N\u00edvel Intermedi\u00e1rio) se aplicam, com ordena\u00e7\u00e3o de bytes ligeiramente alteradas. O que \u00e9 visto como leg\u00edvel em 16 bits muda drasticamente no interior de um core LE.\n\n\nExemplo: AB CD WX YZ primeiro pega os bits de A, vira-os como se estivessem olhando em um espelho; bits de B bits e vira-os; bits de C... etc, at\u00e9 Z, e ent\u00e3o se torna WXYZ ABCD com os bytes do seu \u00faltimo passo.\n\n\nPara adicionar o suporte LE, voc\u00ea estar\u00e1 escrevendo uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00facleo falso (Mem 0x000001 = Mem 0x000001), copiando suas condi\u00e7\u00f5es originais n\u00e3o-LE com um 'PauseIf\nna parte superior em uma Alt, copie as mesmas condi\u00e7\u00f5es para a outra. Ambos os 'PauseIf\ns conter\u00e3o um cheque olhando para um endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria que nunca muda para ver se o seu valor de 16 bits teve o seu pedido de bytes alterado (Pense nisso como \" \nPauseIf\n n\u00e3o estou no n\u00facleo LE\" e \"\nPauseIf\n eu sou\" nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es alt).\n\n\nUm funcionar\u00e1 se o jogador estiver executando em um n\u00facleo LE, o outro n\u00e3o. Em seguida, voc\u00ea executar\u00e1 a matem\u00e1tica que descrevi acima nos valores que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 procurando no \"\nPauseIf\n, n\u00e3o estou no LE core\" Alt, e atualizando-o.\n\n\nConfuso? Sim. \u00c9 por isso que a maioria dos iniciantes e desenvolvedores intermedi\u00e1rios n\u00e3o deve se preocupar.\n\n\nDicas de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de achievements\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNunca use / Evite usar apenas uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o, tanto quanto voc\u00ea puder\n. Ao usar apenas uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o, o achievement provavelmente ir\u00e1 aparecer na hora errada. Este \u00e9 o \nerro mais comum cometido por um desenvolvedor\n, resultando na justificativa \"Popped at the Wrong Time\" anexada nos Bug Tickets recebidos em RetroAchievements.org. Programe suas conquistas com robustez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf Demo Mode\n:  Se o jogo tiver um modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o (AI joga o jogo depois de esperar um pouco na tela de t\u00edtulo), assegure-se de encontrar o endere\u00e7o para isso e adicione \nmode != Demo\n ou algo semelhante em suas conquistas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReiniciar Acontece\n: Alguns emuladores enviam um valor espec\u00edfico para a RAM quando reiniciados / recarregados. \u00c9 apenas para o primeiro quadro, mas pode fazer com que os achievements disparem, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea precisa se preparar para isso. Geralmente, \u00e9 um valor como o FF. Voc\u00ea pode ver o valor se voc\u00ea usar Frame Advance / Next Frame ao reiniciar o jogo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimita\u00e7\u00f5es\n:  H\u00e1 um limite de 100 achievements, um teto de 400 pontos e um limite de caracteres para uma \u00fanica conquista (tente n\u00e3o colocar mais de 50 condi\u00e7\u00f5es em uma conquista, isso \u00e9 mais amor do que o RetroAchievements consegue lidar!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlt groups\n (lado esquerdo do editor) s\u00e3o usados para \"ou\" condi\u00e7\u00f5es.

Agora, se, por exemplo, os desbloqueios de itens usam todos os 8 bits do endere\u00e7o de 8 bits e voc\u00ea quer fazer \"desbloquear todos os itens\", voc\u00ea pode apenas fazer \"8 bits x = 0xff\" Isso pode ser confuso, mas \u00e9 muito importante para entender. Alguns jogos com espa\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria limitado usam muito os campos de bits! \u00c9 uma t\u00e9cnica importante para aprender.",

Raramente os jogadores podem se confundir.\n\n\nExemplos:\n Progresso em fases f\u00e1ceis, pegando 100 moedas, coletando uma pena, coletando 20 an\u00e9is. Pegando o primeiro upgrade, indo para uma fase secreta muito conhecida. Lutando com um chefe facil: a maioria dos chefes em Super Mario World, completando fases iniciais em Sonic The Hedgehog.\n\n\n2 - M\u00e9dio\nlink\n\n\nA Maioria dos jogadores consegue pegar na primeira tentativa. Muitos poderiam depois de algumas tentativas. Alguns ir\u00e3o precisar praticar.

Geralmente pega uma pr\u00e1tica significante, altas habilidades, experi\u00eancia, pesquisas ou guias para completar\n\n\nExemplos:\n Zerando Contra com uma vida. Escapando de Zebes (Super Metroid) abaixo de dois minutos. Derrotando muitos chefes de Megaman sem tomar dano. Muitos est\u00e1gios sem danos, dependendo do jogo.\n\n\n6 - Super Dif\u00edcil\nlink\n\n\nA Maioria dos jogadores n\u00e3o ser\u00e3o capaz de completar isto depois de d\u00fazias de tentativas.

Os jogadores mais qualificados ainda consideram isso extremamente dif\u00edcil. Pode levar os esfor\u00e7os de maratonas para reiniciar\n\n\nExemplos:\n Completar um jogo sem tomar dano, especialmente se o jogador tiver uma barra de vida, desafios que restringem drasticamente o jogador e exigem precis\u00e3o quase perfeita para o sucesso. Zerar Contra duas vezes com uma vida. Zerando Megaman sem tomar dano. Zerar Super Mario Bros sem coletar power-ups, coletando apenas 2 moedas, e com a pontua\u00e7\u00e3o abaixo de 500\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2018-03-26 02:38] KingDice001:\n Updated Difficulty Scale and Balance pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-26 02:37] KingDice001:\n Updated Difficulty Scale and Balance pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-26 02:36] KingDice001:\n Updated Difficulty Scale and Balance pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-26 02:35] KingDice001:\n Updated Difficulty Scale and Balance pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-26 02:19] KingDice001:\n Updated Difficulty Scale and Balance pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-25 16:34] KingDice001:\n Created Difficulty Scale and Balance pt_BR (markdown)",

Voc\u00ea pode ser como esses endere\u00e7os est\u00e3o classificados na mem\u00f3ria. Em nosso exemplo nos temos:\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10\n \u00e9 o nivel, e espera-se que seja \n0\n (o primeiro nivel).\n\n\n0xf601\n \u00e9 um endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria de 8 bits, e nos usamos o prefixo \n0xh\n em vez de \n0x\n para significar isso. \n0xf601\n \u00e9 o modo de tela. A segunda e a terceira parte desta Condi\u00e7\u00e3o de In\u00edcio est\u00e1 dizendo \"o modo atual deve ser \ningame\n (\n0c\n), e o modo no frame anterior N\u00c3O deve ser \ningame\n\". \nNota\n: O prefixo \"d\" no endere\u00e7o representa delta, ou \"o valor do frame anterior\". \nResumindo\n: ative o leaderboard imediatamente ap\u00f3s iniciar uma fase (a partir da\u00ed vamos come\u00e7ar a medir o tempo).\n\n\nFinalmente n\u00f3s al\u00e9m de esperar que \n0xfff0\n seja aquivalente a \n0\n, porque \n0xfff0\n \u00e9 o modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00f3s n\u00e3o queremos enviar pontua\u00e7\u00f5es para a leaderboard quando a demo estiver ativa!\n\n\n\n\nCondi\u00e7\u00f5es de Cancelamento\nlink\n\n\nCAN\n: \n0xhfe13<d0xhfe13\n\n\n\n\n0xfe13\n \u00e9 o numero de vidas.\n\n\n\n\nA se\u00e7\u00e3o de cancelamento checa se o contador de VIDAS do jogador se tormar menor. Literalmente, isto diz \"Cancela se o ATUAL valor em 0xfe13 \u00e9 menor que o valor ANTERIOR em 0xfe13. N\u00f3s queremos que fa\u00e7a isso porque voce pode alcan\u00e7ar o checkpoint final e correr fora do tempo, resetando seu contador para 0:00. Nos n\u00e3o queremos permitir isso, porque isto n\u00e3o \u00e9 a forma correta de completar o nivel. Ent\u00e3o, se o jogardor morrer, n\u00f3s resetamos o progresso do leaderboard dele.\n\n\nCondi\u00e7\u00f5es de envio\nlink\n\n\nSUB\n: \n0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0\n\n\n\n\n0xf7cc\n isto \u00e9 a bandeira de final de fase, n\u00e3o-interativo.\n\n\n\n\nA se\u00e7\u00e3o de envio checa se o frame atual tem o marcador de 'endlevel' (fim de fase) for para verdadeiro (ou \n!=0\n, 'naozero'), e o frame anterior (delta) tem isto para ser falso (ou \n=0\n, 'zero'). Isto sugere que o jogador chegou ao fim do nivel, e provou ser um benchmark bastante robusto\n\n\nDica\n: isto pode ser \u00fatil para observar estes valores na mem\u00f3ria para ver como eles executam, e que tipo de valores eles terminam em diferentes circunst\u00e2ncias.\n\n\nInterpretador de Valores\nlink\n\n\nVAL\n: \n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nFinalmente, valores. Uma vez que o jogador chegou ao inicio da condi\u00e7\u00e3o, eles ir\u00e3o ser mostrados em uma caixa quue permanece na tela, aparecendo o progresso deles at\u00e9 agora. Se \u00e9 uma leaderboard de tempo, ser\u00e1 um rel\u00f3gio, e se for uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o, ser\u00e1 apenas o valor. Se eles cumprirem a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de cancelamento, eles ser\u00e3o informados de que eles falharam, e o pop-up ser\u00e1 removido. Se caso o jogador chegar com sucesso \u00e0 condi\u00e7\u00e3o de envio, o valor atual ser\u00e1 pego e submetido como pontua\u00e7\u00e3o. o pop-up ingame ir\u00e1 informar o jogador o t\u00e3o longe da leaderboard, e a posi\u00e7\u00e3o deles na leaderboard.\n\n\nA condi\u00e7\u00e3o de valor \u00e9 especial em poucas maneiras. Ele \u00e9 avaliado constantemente e exibido na tela o tempo todo quando a leaderboard est\u00e1 ativa. Isto n\u00e3o funciona como as outras condi\u00e7\u00f5es. Isto espera endere\u00e7os da seguinte maneira:\n\n\nendere\u00e7o*modificador\n (endere\u00e7o tempo modificador)\n\n\ne usa o \n_\n sublinhado como um 'plus'. O \n*\n asterisco significa 'm\u00faltiplo', ent\u00e3o no valor\n\n\n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nrepresenta:\n\n\n8-bit \n0xfe24\n vezes 1, MAIS\n8-bit \n0xfe25\n vezes 60, MAIS\n8-bit \n0xfe22\n vezes 3600\n\n\nA raz\u00e3o para isso \u00e9 que os valores em cada um desses endere\u00e7os significam frames, segundos e minutos respectivamentes. Quando nos adicionamos esses valores juntos, n\u00f3s conseguimos um grande total em frames que vamos enviar para o \"Banco de dados\".\n\n\nLembre que o campo 'Formato' pode ser \nPontua\u00e7\u00e3o\n, \nTempo (Frames)\n, \nTempo (Milisegundos)\n ou \nValor\n. \nTempo(Frames)\n \u00e9 o mais comum, e representa 'frames'. \nTempo (Milisegundos)\n espera um valor que nos podemos converter diretamente para milisegundos. (Super Mario Kart usa isso). No entanto, para converter um valor em frame dentro de um formato \"para ser lidos por humanos\", nos devemos dividiu o valor por 60 para uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o de segundos correta, e um valor em milisegundos deve ser dividido por 100 para conseguir o numero de segundos. Isso \u00e9 usado no site e no aplicativo para exibir o valor apropriadamente, e \u00e9 importante para distinguir, para que possamos ter certeza de obter o valor mais preciso do emulador, usando qualquer formato que eles usem para registrar o tempo.\n\n\nAjuda Adicional\nlink\n\n\nInfelizmente h\u00e1 \nMUITAS\n maneiras de este processo dar errado, ent\u00e3o, se voce tiver algum problema, sinta-se livre pra pedir ajuda em nosso \nservidor do Discord\n.\n\n\nSe voc\u00ea quer praticar, \u00e9 altamente recomendado criar sua pr\u00f3pria leaderboard e tentar alguma coisa em um novo jogo, melhor que usar uma leaderboard existente\n\n\nPor favor, lembre-se que esses arquivos s\u00e3o puxados diretamente para o jogo de algu\u00e9m se eles decidirem jog\u00e1-lo, e uma m\u00e1 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de endere\u00e7o de mem\u00f3ria ou linha pode causar um crash no emulador, ent\u00e3o por favor, teste seu c\u00f3digo da leaderboard!\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2018-03-28 11:35] meleu:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 03:15] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:56] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:55] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:49] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:44] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:38] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:37] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:36] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-28 02:35] KingDice001:\n Updated Leaderboards pt_BR (markdown)",

Resumindo : ative o leaderboard imediatamente ap\u00f3s iniciar uma fase (a partir da\u00ed vamos come\u00e7ar a medir o tempo).  Finalmente n\u00f3s al\u00e9m de esperar que  0xfff0  seja aquivalente a  0 , porque  0xfff0  \u00e9 o modo de demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00f3s n\u00e3o queremos enviar pontua\u00e7\u00f5es para a leaderboard quando a demo estiver ativa!",

Se a cl\u00e1usula condicional avaliar que \u00e9 verdadeiro (true), a parte restante da linha ser\u00e1 usada como a sequ\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o. Se n\u00e3o avaliar true, o processamento prosseguir\u00e1 para a pr\u00f3xima linha. Se come\u00e7ar com um ponto de interroga\u00e7\u00e3o, o mesmo processo ser\u00e1 repetido. Se n\u00e3o come\u00e7ar com um ponto de interroga\u00e7\u00e3o, a linha inteira ser\u00e1 usada como a sequ\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00e3o.  Olhando para este exemplo, se o valor de 16 bits em $ 0085 for 0, a seq\u00fc\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9  Title Screen . Se n\u00e3o, a pr\u00f3xima linha \u00e9 examinada. Se o s\u00e9timo bit de $ 007C for 1, a cadeia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 Custom  Map em @Landscape (0xH00016c) . Se n\u00e3o, a linha final n\u00e3o tem uma cl\u00e1usula condicional e \u00e9 usada.  As cadeias de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o associadas a uma cl\u00e1usula condicional suportam a mesma sintaxe que a cadeia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00e3o. Neste exemplo, voc\u00ea pode ver que a pesquisa  @Landscape  \u00e9 usada na seq\u00fc\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o condicional e na sequ\u00eancia de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00e3o. A pesquisa em si s\u00f3 precisa ser definida uma vez.  A frase condicional suporta todos os assessores de endere\u00e7o mencionados anteriormente, bem como a l\u00f3gica AND (_) e OR (S). Note que cl\u00e1usulas OR ainda requerem um grupo 'core',  just like achievements.   ? 0xH1234 = 32_0xH2345 = 0? and example   se o valor de 8 bits em $ 1234 for 32 e o valor de 8 bits em $ 2345 for 0, display  and example   ? 0xH1234 = 32_0xH2345 = 1S0xH2345 = 2? or example   se o valor de 8 bits em $ 1234 for 32 e o valor de 8 bits em $ 2345 for 1 ou 2, exibir  or example",

N\u00e3o o lado t\u00e9cnico, mas o lado conceitual.\n\n\nEste conteudo \u00e9 um resumo do que foi \noriginalmente escrito pelo usu\u00e1rio cirellio em um forum\n.  \ntexto em ingl\u00eas\n\n\nConquistas Baseadas em Progresso\nlink\n\n\nH\u00e1 3 tipos de conquistas baseadas em progresso: progresso simples, progresso baseado na hist\u00f3ria, e conquistas baseadas em progresso/coletagem.\n\n\nProgresso Simples\nlink\n\n\nConquistas baseadas em Progresso s\u00e3o geralmente mais simples, especialmente se o jogo que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo n\u00e3o passa de fases lineares. Ou n\u00e3o tem muita coisa acontecendo na hist\u00f3ria. Neste caso, vamos dar uma olhadas em alguns exemplos BONS e RUINS disto:\n\n\n\n\nBom: Clear Stage 1. (Conclua o 1 estagio)\n\n\nRuim: Reach Stage 2. (Chegue o 2 estagio)\n\n\n\n\n\u00c9 preciso um pouco mais de trabalho para codificar uma conquista em que o jogador precisa concluir a fase, em vez de simplesmente chegar a pr\u00f3xima. Mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito mais satisfat\u00f3rio para o jogador, e tem muito mais um olhar profissional. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 \nmenos suscet\u00edvel a problemas com jogadores que carregam save games ou savestates para ganhar conquistas em massa\n \nNota do tradutor: Em outras palavras: Evitar Cheats\n\n\n\n\nBom: Complete o jogo.\n\n\nRuim: Inicie o jogo.\n\n\n\n\nEnquanto as conquistas baseadas em progresso s\u00e3o frequentemente brindes, geralmente \u00e9 concordado aqui que uma conquista para come\u00e7ar o jogo \u00e9 um pouco f\u00e1cil demais, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada memor\u00e1vel para o jogador. \u00c9 apenas uma formalidade. E finalizando o jogo, no entanto, \u00e9 frequentemente a parte do jogo mais memor\u00e1vel para um jogador, e completar um jogo \u00e9 definitivamente uma conquista em si. \u00c9 uma boa pr\u00e1tica fazer essas conquistas como \"Derrote o ultimo chefe/fase e conclua o jogo\"\n\n\n\n\nBom: Conclua as fases tem\u00e1ticas de gelo, ou Conclua as cinco primeiras fases, ou Conclua as dez primeiras fases.\n\n\nRuim: Complete a fase 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (todas as conquistas separadas)\n\n\n\n\nUma das piores coisas que voc\u00ea pode fazer \u00e9 criar spams de conquistas. Jogos de Puzzles s\u00e3o not\u00e1veis por esses tipos de problemas, porque as fases s\u00e3o curtas e existem centenas delas ou mais. Como um resultado, o feed da p\u00e1gina principal fica com muitas micro-atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es, que \"spama\" as conquistas das outras pessoas para baixo e pra fora da p\u00e1gina principal rapidamente. A maneira de se mostrar mais profissional nessa quest\u00e3o \u00e9 ampliar um pouco mais as conquistas, em grupos de fases. Por exemplo, se os est\u00e1gios 1-10 s\u00e3o todas tem\u00e1ticas de fogo, e as fases 11-20 s\u00e3o tem\u00e1ticas de espa\u00e7o sideral, voc\u00ea pode criar conquistas ao redor desses temas. Seja criativo.\n\n\nProgresso Baseado na hist\u00f3ria:\nlink\n\n\nOs momentos mais memor\u00e1veis na hist\u00f3ria dos jogos muitas vezes n\u00e3o est\u00e3o relacionados \u00e0 cole\u00e7\u00e3o de itens ou sidequests, mas para cenas espec\u00edficas relacionadas \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria\n\n\nExemplos:\n\n- O primeiro encontro com Pyramid Head na s\u00e9rie Silent Hill\n- Encontrar a verdade sobre Darth Revan em Knights of the Old Republic\n- Encontrar o que ir\u00e1 acontecer no futuro em Chrono Trigger\n- Lan\u00e7ar a vaca em Earthworm Jim.\n- Praticamente qualquer morte de personagem.\n\n\nA coisa que voc\u00ea tem que ter cuidado extra \u00e9 com os spoilers. Se voc\u00ea pegar uma conquista baseada em progresso que tem um spoiler, contacte um desenvolvedor sobre isso. E os desenvolvedores, por favor, seja receptivo quando vier cr\u00edticas construtivas! Al\u00e9m disso, o n\u00famero e at\u00e9 a porcentagem deles ir\u00e3o variar de jogo para jogo--E depende muito de como o jogo \u00e9 baseado na hist\u00f3ria.\n\n\nProgresso/Coletagem\nlink\n\n\nProgresso/Coletagem \u00e9 um h\u00edbrido comum. N\u00e3o apenas em voc\u00ea coletar um item, mas tamb\u00e9m inicia uma cena memor\u00e1vel (e obrigat\u00f3ria).\n\n\nExemplos\n\n- Obter a Master Sword em Link to the Past, que sustenta a maldi\u00e7\u00e3o em Lost Woods\n- Encontrar a espada na praia em Link's Awakening, na primeira cena em que a coruja s\u00e1bia fala com voc\u00ea.\n- Pegar o seu Pokemon inicial, que acontece durante uma cena inicial, mas \u00e9 um \"ritual de passagem\" para a maioria dos jogadores.\n\n\nConquistas nesta categoria h\u00edbrida podem oferecer muito mais satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o porquer eles s\u00e3o Conquistas nesta categoria h\u00edbrida geralmente s\u00e3o mais satisfat\u00f3rios pois eles desempenham um papel duplo. O jogador n\u00e3o est\u00e1 apenas pegando um item, mas tamb\u00e9m assistindo uma cena memor\u00e1vel e farturando uma conquista, tudo de uma vez. Que enxurrada de endorfina!\n\n\nPr\u00f3s e Contras em Progresso\nlink\n\n\nConquistas em Progresso s\u00e3o garantidos ao jogador em uma jogada normal. Ent\u00e3o, por que t\u00ea-los?\n\n\nPr\u00f3s\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUm jogador merece os pontos por jogar! Fa\u00e7a eles! Lembre, um monte de pessoas estar\u00e3o jogando esses jogos pela primeira vez, e muitos jogos s\u00e3o um pouco dificeis para se zerar. Por que n\u00e3o devemos recompensar os jogadores por uma boa e normal jogada?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPr\u00eamios de progress\u00e3o peri\u00f3dicos ajudam a encorajar os jogadores a completar um jogo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlguns jogadores s\u00e3o mais casuais e n\u00e3o pretendem fazer muito mais do que zerar jogos neste site. Nem todo mundo sente a necessidade de platinar todos os jogos no modo Hardcore. Muitos ficam perfeitamente felizes em conseguir qualquer conquista que possam ter durante uma jogada normal, e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de errado com isso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgumas cenas s\u00e3o t\u00e3o memor\u00e1veis que merecem conquistas pr\u00f3prias! As pessoas que cresceram com esses jogos e os amam, tem o costume de procurar essas cenas em listas de conquistas, e isso pode apenas aquecer seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o quando elas perceberem que isso foi reconhecido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConquistas de progresso ajudam outras pessoas no site a avaliar a dist\u00e2ncia de um jogador em um jogo, parecido com o \nEstado de Presen\u00e7a\n. N\u00f3s podemos \"soltar uma linha\" para o jogador e dizer: \"Boa sorte!\" porque sabemos que a pr\u00f3xima parte \u00e9 bem complicada. Encoraja a comunidade a interagir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA ordem importa! Conquistas em Progresso podem nos dizer muito sobre o progresso apenas pela ordem que elas ocorram. Se voc\u00ea ativar aquela conquista de boss opcional e conseguiu um milh\u00e3o de dolares, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo todas as sidequests, isso \u00e9 muito menos impressionante do que se voc\u00ea conseguir tir\u00e1-lo bem antes do meio do jogo. Em outras palavras, conquistas em progresso nos permite mostrar um pouco! Podemos mostrar ao mundo que podemos vencer o chefe final antes de chegarmos ao n\u00edvel 10, ou que podemos finalizar o Expert Mode antes de ir primeiro no Facil e Normal. \nPode at\u00e9 revelar se usamos falhas ou truques para pular certas partes do jogo\n. Ent\u00e3o, como voc\u00ea pode ver, conquistas em progresso tem grande SINERGIA com outros tipos de conquistas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsses tipos de conquistas s\u00e3o as mais faceis de codificar e s\u00e3o geralmente livres de erros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContras\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuitas Conquistas em Progresso podem saturar um jogo com 'brindes', e isto \u00e9 uma Coisa Muito Ruim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe todo o seu jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada alem do que esses tipos de conquistas, entao \u00e9 apenas uma jogatina chata para os jogadores. Chegue a fase 2, Chegue a fase 3, Chegue a fase 4, Complete o Jogo. Estas as uma grande 'base' para voc\u00ea come\u00e7ar a adicionar conquistas de outras categorias, mas \nn\u00e3o deixe que listas apenas com conquistas em progresso\n se voc\u00ea pode ajudar com isso. Outra coisa al\u00e9m disso voc\u00ea apenas estar\u00e1 recompensando jogadores por fazer coisa que eles j\u00e1 fizeram um milh\u00e3o de vezes antes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidequest/Conquistas Opcionais\nlink\n\n\nOs jogos antigos, por si s\u00f3, oferecem pouco ou nenhum incentivo para zerar um bonus, al\u00e9m de que \u00e9 algo para fazer em um dia chuvoso depois de voc\u00ea ter zerado o jogo. Jogos antigos n\u00e3o tinham conectividade com a Internet. E eles n\u00e3o tinham aspectos sociais al\u00e9m de 2 jogadores, e talvez dizendo a seus amigos da escola que voc\u00ea vencesse alguma coisa. Mas agora, com o Retroachievements.org, nos podemos mostrar seus trof\u00e9is antigos (mesmo que isso nos obrigue a refazer o que provavelmente j\u00e1 fizemos h\u00e1 muitos anos). Estes trof\u00e9is s\u00e3o emblemas de honra. Voc\u00ea pode olhar as conquistas de outros membros e come\u00e7ar a entender o qu\u00e3o longe eles foram, o qu\u00e3o h\u00e1beis eles s\u00e3o. Junto com isso vem o respeito dos outros membros. N\u00f3s socializamos, n\u00f3s parabenizamos uns aos outros por um trabalho bem feito. E n\u00f3s somos uma boa compania.\n\n\nSidequests\nlink\n\n\nMuitas vezes h\u00e1 coisas que o jogador pode fazer que est\u00e3o confinados \u00e0s regras do jogo, mas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias para complet\u00e1-lo. Em outras palavras, um desafio contruido para o jogo pelos desenvolvedores originais do jogo. Geralmente elas s\u00e3o divertidos, mas merecem ser ganhos porque elas requerem trabalho duro e pesistencia para ganhar. Voc\u00ea tem que caminhar em uma corda bamba bem entre se jogadores dedicados s\u00e3o propensos a fazer algo, vs. se o objetivo \u00e9 estupido. As pessoas ter\u00e3o vis\u00f5es diferentes sobre isso, ent\u00e3o fortale\u00e7a-se.\n\n\nMuitas vezes, esses tipos de conquistas s\u00e3o at\u00e9 Easter Eggs ou coisas que o jogador nunca soube que existiam em toda a sua vida! Muitos jogadores adoram esses tipos de conquistas. Provavelmente porque eles acabam conhecendo algo novo  sobre um jogo que eles cresceram jogando, ou talvez por perceber que aquele segredo do jogo que \"s\u00f3 ele conhece\" est\u00e1 sendo suportado aqui. \n\u00c9 muito importante para n\u00f3s desenvolvedores conhecer MUITO BEM o jogo antes de criar um set de conquistas.\n\n\nExemplos de Sidequests:\n\n\n\n\nEntregando caudas para o Coletor de Caudas em Final Fantasy IV.\n\n\nEncontrar ao dono do Item Insignificante em Earthbound.\n\n\nEntregar o \"Jerky\" para o Rei em Guardia Castle.\n\n\nFazer a sidequest do Anju em Majora's Mask.\n\n\nAprender sobre o passado de Wrex em Mass Effect\n\n\nEscoltar Uma pessoa muito Importante em Flashback: The Quest for Identity.\n\n\nDescobrir uma sala secreta.\n\n\n\n\nSidequests s\u00e3o mais frequentemente encontrados em RPGs, mas especialmente nesses dias, sidequests s\u00e3o encontrandas em quase todos os g\u00eaneros. Mantenha seus olhos abertos, jogos de plataforma pode tem uma ou tr\u00eas sidequests. Os jogos da s\u00e9rie Kirby por exemplo, tem muitas salas e \u00e1reas escondidas. Muitas vezes, sidequests acabam com \"ganhando um item\" no qual acaba sendo um hibrido: Sidequest/Coletagem.\n\n\nConquitas Opcionais\nlink\n\n\n\n\nChefes Opcionais\n\n\nConcluir o desafio de uma dungeon (Que \u00e9 um h\u00edbrido de Sidequest)\n\n\nCompletar o Modo Expert (que \u00e9 um h\u00edbrido de progress\u00e3o)\n\n\nCompletar um desafio secreto.\n\n\nConseguir a exce\u00e7\u00e3o de de conseguir pegar um item de um monstro. (Pegar um item raro)\n\n\nCompletar o jogo com um personagem opcional.\n\n\nConseguir uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o alta\n\n\nConseguir coisas que apenas s\u00e3o desbloqueadas em uma segunda jogatina\n\n\nModos de jogos que s\u00e3o apenas desbloqueadas em multiplas jogatinas\n\n\nVer finais opcionais\n\n\nColocar c\u00f3digos para deixar o jogo mais dificil (Passwords e senhas)\n\n\n\n\nEstes s\u00e3o os criadores do jogo esperando que voc\u00ea goste de seu jogo o suficiente para continuar voltando para mais, mesmo depois que esses cr\u00e9ditos terminarem. Eles est\u00e3o tentando recompensar o jogador por completar seu jogo e criar alguma forma de satisfazer uma segunda jogatina. Se os criadores do jogo tem problemas de fazer essas coisas como parte integral do jogo, nos como desenvolvedores de conquistas devemos reconhecer esses desafios e criar conquistas apropriadas para pelo menos alguns deles.\n\n\nChrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story s\u00e3o famosos por isso. De fato, muitos jogos fazem isso. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem certeza se o seu jogo tem modos extras ou desafios, tenha certeza de fazer alguma pesquisa e chegar alguns FAQs. Ou perguntar na nossa comunidade, muitos de n\u00f3s somos experts nos jogos que s\u00e3o suportados aqui.\n\n\nPr\u00f3s e Contras de Sidequests/Opcionais\nlink\n\n\nConquistas de Sidequests/Opcional fazem complementos fant\u00e1sticos para Conquistas de Progresso.\n\n\nPr\u00f3s\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsto \u00e9 uma m\u00e3o-na-roda de fazer conquistas. As chances s\u00e3o, uma boa parte das conquistas que voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 fazer ser\u00e3o desta categoria. Todos os jogos tem coisas opcionais para se fazer. Como coletar todas as moedas em uma fase! Ganhar 9 vidas! Criar conquistas com esse tipo de conte\u00fado \u00e9 facil, e recompensar o jogar pela sua dedica\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriadores de jogos amam jogadores apreciativos. Eles adoram quando os jogadores se incomodam em procurar fundo em seus jogos, apreciam seu trabalho duro, caso contr\u00e1rio, n\u00e3o ver\u00edamos coisas 'divertidas' escondidas em jogos como Easter Eggs, cenas bonus, etc. Se um criador de jogos recompensa os jogadores por fazer isso, por n\u00f3s n\u00e3o? Nos desenvolvedores devemos reconhecer que o jogador foi al\u00e9m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOs jogadores adoram contar aos seus amigos quando encontram algo incomum e fora do comum em um jogo. Neste site, eles podem mostrar aos seus amigos que eles realmente mataram o 'sapo amarelo' raramente visto no p\u00e2ntano, ou encontar o portal para a 'dimens\u00e3o misteriosa'. Se nos incluimos essas curiosidade em nossa lista de conquistas, n\u00f3s mostramos aos jogadores que estamos \"no conhecimento\" que cria confian\u00e7a de que podemos gui\u00e1-los competentemente atrav\u00e9s do jogo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConquistas de Sidequests/Opcionais d\u00e3o aos jogadores algo para se esfor\u00e7ar por depois que eles zerarem o jogo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsses tipos de conquistas podem frequentemente serem ganhados em qualquer tempo e n\u00e3o est\u00e3o em um cronograma programado. Jogadores sentem uma corrida extra de endorfinas quando aparece uma conquista que eles n\u00e3o esperavam, mas foi conquistada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsses tipos de conquistas s\u00e3o geralmente faceis de fazer, segundo, apenas para conquistas de estilo de progresso\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContras\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlguns jogadores n\u00e3o se importam em explorar al\u00e9m de uma jogatina t\u00edpica do que ofecere, ent\u00e3o uma alta porcentagem desses tipos de conquistas em um jogo pode deixar o jogador abaixo da recompensa. (Este tipo de jogador \u00e9 um pouco raro em um site concentrado em conquistas.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgumas pessoas podem sentir um desafio espec\u00edfico muito dif\u00edcil, mesmo se \u00e9 algo que os desenvolvedores do jogo original incluiram no jogo para os jogadores conseguirem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuando voc\u00ea cria uma conquista de Sidequest/Opcional para, digamos, fugir de 999 batalhas (ou outras conquistas de maximizar o status), voc\u00ea corre o risco de que as pessoas neste site n\u00e3o sintam que essa conquista em particular ofere\u00e7a um desafio e \u00e9 apenas um grind (grind \u00e9 quando se h\u00e1 repeti\u00e7\u00e3o de uma parte para se ganhar experi\u00eancia). Conquistas como essas podem muito bem acabar sendo envias para o \"N\u00e3o-oficial\", a menos que sirvam a um segundo prop\u00f3sito como em Final Fantasy V quando correr de batalhas pode melhor uma arma chamada 'Chicken Knife'. Isto tem SINERGIA com o jogo, ao contr\u00e1rio de criar uma conquista baseada no aumento de n\u00edvel que n\u00e3o tem utilidade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConquistas baseadas em coletas\nlink\n\n\nA maioria das conquistas baseadas em coleta s\u00e3o opcionais, a menos que os itens em si sejam MacGuffins, que, nesse caso, cairiam diretamente em Progress\u00e3o / Cole\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\n\nExemplos:\n\n\n\n\nEncontrar os chap\u00e9us de Mickey escondidos no cen\u00e1rio para obter 1 vida em Aladdin (Mega Drive).\n\n\nEncontrar itens excepcionalmente bem escondidos\n\n\nBesti\u00e1rios.\n\n\nDesbloquear um personagem opcional.\n\n\nMaximizar dinheiro / kills / status.\n\n\nEncontrar todas as maneiras diferentes de morrer em jogos como Prince of Persia ou Shadowgate.\n\n\nAbrindo todos os ba\u00fas do tesouro em um jogo / encontrando cada powerup.\n\n\nTodos os itens / Coletando 99 ou 255 (etc.) de um item.\n\n\nCapturando todos os Pokemon (qualquer cole\u00e7\u00e3o de monstros, na verdade.)\n\n\n\n\nSe o jogo acompanhar uma estat\u00edstica, o desenvolvedor do jogo est\u00e1 praticamente desafiando voc\u00ea a maximiz\u00e1-lo. Agora, voc\u00ea pode ser esse tipo de jogador, e voc\u00ea pode n\u00e3o ser. Voc\u00ea tem que perguntar a si mesmo, como um desenvolvedor, se os outros jogadores provavelmente obter\u00e3o 9999 mortes de um inimigo, mesmo que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o o fa\u00e7a. As vantagens disso s\u00e3o que as pessoas que normalmente n\u00e3o fazem isso sempre t\u00eam algo para voltar e trabalhar quando sentem vontade de jogar novamente. A desvantagem \u00e9 que outros jogadores que normalmente n\u00e3o ir\u00e3o t\u00e3o longe e talvez n\u00e3o o fa\u00e7a, mas tamb\u00e9m sentem que precisam PLATINAR rapidamente todos os jogos (raros de encontrar), v\u00e3o reclamar. Se voc\u00ea receber reclama\u00e7\u00f5es suficientes, voc\u00ea pode querer reduzir 9999 algo mais razo\u00e1vel, como 500. Se ningu\u00e9m est\u00e1 se divertindo com uma conquista, n\u00e3o \u00e9 no esp\u00edrito de jogar ou fazer uma conquista.\n\n\nVoc\u00ea tem que usar seu melhor julgamento aqui e pensar no que o jogador mais gosta. Como regra geral, \u00e9 melhor ter algumas conquistas paralelos / opcionais do que nenhuma. Mas com um pouco de esfor\u00e7o extra, essas conquistas podem tornar sua lista muito memor\u00e1vel.\n\n\nEm seguida, \u00e9 hora de arrega\u00e7ar as mangas como desenvolvedores e ser REALMENTE criativos quando os pr\u00f3prios desenvolvedores desafiam o jogador al\u00e9m das regras do jogo.\n\n\nConquistas divertidas\nlink\n\n\nEste tipo de conquistas geralmente vale apenas alguns pontos, mas eles ainda s\u00e3o divertidos\n\n\nExemplos de divers\u00e3o:\n\n\n\n\nDeixando o rel\u00f3gio marcar 99:59 em Valkyrie Profile.\n\n\nFundos interativos, como cutucar o cad\u00e1ver pendurado no est\u00e1gio 1 de Castlevania: Bloodlines.\n\n\nCozinhando o hamster no microondas em Maniac Mansion.\n\n\nAssistindo o apocalipse em Majora's Mask.\n\n\nEncontrando John Romero em Doom 2.\n\n\n\u00c0s vezes, criadores de jogos adicionam easter eggs (segredos) divertidos. Para entreter o jogador com 'e se isso estivesse ali?'. Mais uma vez, \u00e9 nosso trabalho, como desenvolvedores, reconhec\u00ea-los e apoi\u00e1-los o m\u00e1ximo que pudermos.\n\n\n\n\nDesafios\nlink\n\n\nUma coisa que voc\u00ea deve lembrar sobre os jogadores retr\u00f4 - e os jogos que eles jogam - \u00e9 que a maioria de n\u00f3s j\u00e1 jogou esses jogos um milh\u00e3o de vezes antes. Esta \u00e9 a mesma velha m\u00fasica e dan\u00e7a para a maioria de n\u00f3s, e muitas vezes precisamos de motiva\u00e7\u00e3o para faz\u00ea-lo novamente. Alguns de n\u00f3s podem terminar o Contra sem perder uma \u00fanica vida. Bem, agora \u00e9 a nossa chance de provar isso!\n\n\nQuero dizer, pense nisso: antes deste site, a \u00fanica maneira de provar que voc\u00ea pode fazer uma corrida impec\u00e1vel de Contra era convidar um amigo, sentar e mostrar a ele, ou descobrir software de grava\u00e7\u00e3o e fazer um v\u00eddeo no YouTube. Mas mesmo assim, muitos desses v\u00eddeos s\u00e3o manipulados para se parecer com jogos perfeitos. Este site, no entanto, tem o modo Hardcore, que ajuda a indicar que ningu\u00e9m est\u00e1 trapaceando.\n\n\nVoc\u00ea pode ter Conquistas progressivas e Sidequest / Conquistas Opcionais, mas se voc\u00ea quiser criar uma lista de conquistas que seja realmente \u00f3tima, voc\u00ea precisa de pelo menos algumas Conquistas de Desafio. Tente pensar em todos os jogos que voc\u00ea jogou aqui neste site. Quais s\u00e3o algumas das realiza\u00e7\u00f5es mais memor\u00e1veis? Eu quase posso garantir que eles eram Conquistas de Desafio. Existem exce\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e0 regra, \u00e9 claro, mas o jogador t\u00edpico n\u00e3o vai se lembrar com carinho, Concluir a fase 2-6', ou 'Chegar ao nivel 30'. Eles s\u00e3o mais propensos a se lembrar com carinho de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es que fizeram de seus jogatinas uma experi\u00eancia \u00fanica, como ...\n\n\n\n\npassar o jogo inteiro sem nunca pegar um powerup ou moeda\n\n\nderrotar um chefe sem ser atingido\n\n\nterminar um est\u00e1gio sem perder uma vida\n\n\n\n\nIsso \u00e9 o que torna este site t\u00e3o especial, e o que faz das conquistas algo mais do que apenas vencer um jogo.\n\n\nMesmo os cr\u00edticos mais contundentes que odeiam a id\u00e9ia de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es podem dizer: \"Bem, exceto por este. Esse foi bom\". E eu garanto que UM exemplo de que eles est\u00e3o falando \u00e9 uma conquista de desafio, algo que desafiou o jogador al\u00e9m do pr\u00f3prio jogo.\n\n\nUm bom desenvolvedor de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es manter\u00e1 seus olhos abertos, sua intelig\u00eancia sobre eles e seus sentidos afiados ao desenvolver um jogo, procurando por desafios bons e incomuns. Eles podem perceber algo no jogo que \u00e9 um feito dif\u00edcil.\n\n\nDesafios de Speedrun\nlink\n\n\nOs timers apresentam uma press\u00e3o adicional que os jogadores podem nunca ter sentido antes enquanto jogam seus jogos favoritos. Poucas coisas fazem o cora\u00e7\u00e3o bombear mais do que um rel\u00f3gio imponente. Adicione um elemento de temporizador, e um jogo que anteriormente era t\u00e3o f\u00e1cil que eles poderiam venc\u00ea-lo de olhos vendados poderia de repente ser transformado no maior desafio de jogo de suas vidas.\n\n\nExemplos de desafios do Speedrun:\n\n\n\n\nConcluindo um jogo em menos de uma hora.\n\n\nLimpando um est\u00e1gio espec\u00edfico em menos de tr\u00eas minutos.\n\n\nPasse o temporizador em um certo n\u00famero de segundos.\n\n\nMate 30 morcegos durante a sequ\u00eancia de fuga.\n\n\nColete 99 moedas b\u00f4nus antes que a tela b\u00f4nus desapare\u00e7a.\n\n\nV\u00e1 do ponto A ao ponto B antes que o dia mude para a noite.\n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete o jogo com o menor tempo poss\u00edvel.\n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete um determinado est\u00e1gio com o menor tempo poss\u00edvel.\n\n\n\n\nUm desenvolvedor pode querer ir ao YouTube ou Twitch e ver o qu\u00e3o r\u00e1pido as pessoas est\u00e3o terminando um jogo (E, por favor, ignore o TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Alguns corredores profissionais de velocidade s\u00e3o t\u00e3o r\u00e1pidos que o jogador t\u00edpico n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 a menor chance de competir, mas voc\u00ea deve ser capaz de encontrar um ponto m\u00e9dio entre o melhor tempo dele e o seu. E se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o consegue descobrir um bom momento para desafiar os jogadores aqui, \u00e9 para isso que os Leaderboards s\u00e3o - Transforme isso em uma competi\u00e7\u00e3o! Na verdade, alguns de seus favoritos speed-runners podem vir a este site e colocar seus tempos.\n\n\nVoc\u00ea saber\u00e1 quando voc\u00ea est\u00e1 enfrentando uma conquista de press\u00e3o quando as palmas das m\u00e3os est\u00e3o suando e voc\u00ea se v\u00ea nervosamente olhando para o cron\u00f4metro. Como eu disse antes, nada grita: \"Aten\u00e7\u00e3o!\" mais alto que um cron\u00f4metro, especialmente quando os desenvolvedores come\u00e7am a tecer esse tipo de conquista com OUTROS tipos de conquistas (e at\u00e9 placares de l\u00edderes) durante uma parte cronometrada de um jogo. Os Desafios Temporizadores t\u00eam uma quantidade insana de sinergia com outros tipos de conquistas.\n\n\nDesafios de Limita\u00e7\u00e3o\nlink\n\n\nExemplos de Desafios de Limita\u00e7\u00e3o:\n\n\n\n\nLimpar uma batalha ou at\u00e9 mesmo um jogo inteiro com todos os personagens de uma classe espec\u00edfica. (Um exemplo famoso disso \u00e9 terminar o Final Fantasy original com um grupo de White Mages.)\n\n\nDerrote um chefe final sem equipamento.\n\n\nConclua um est\u00e1gio sem nunca saltar.\n\n\nResolva um quebra-cabe\u00e7a em apenas dois movimentos.\n\n\nOne-hit KOs.\n\n\nJogos de baixo n\u00edvel (LLGs).\n\n\nNenhuma conquista de sucesso.\n\n\nNunca aperte em determinado bot\u00e3o durante um desafio.\n\n\nNunca perca a invencibilidade atrav\u00e9s de uma etapa inteira do Mario 3 encontrando estrelas suficientes.\n\n\nDerrote um certo inimigo sem usar um certo movimento.\n\n\nAlcan\u00e7ando Ganon em Legend of Zelda, sem espada.\n\n\nDerrote um certo inimigo SOMENTE usando um certo movimento.\n\n\nTrope\u00e7ar no caminho atrav\u00e9s de um labirinto, enquanto b\u00eabado / confuso.\n\n\nLimpe o jogo com uma doen\u00e7a no status.\n\n\n\n\nOs sites da comunidade constru\u00eddos em torno de determinados jogos s\u00e3o um recurso fant\u00e1stico para esses tipos de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es. Eles ter\u00e3o uma boa id\u00e9ia sobre o que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel e imposs\u00edvel, e provavelmente escreveram perguntas frequentes discutindo maneiras alternativas e desafiadoras de jogar o jogo inteiro.\n\n\nMuitas vezes, por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o haver\u00e1 comunidade. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 perguntas frequentes. Nenhum quadro de mensagens. E talvez nem v\u00eddeos \u00fateis. Nesses casos, voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 ser uma pessoa de ideias para criar maneiras novas e interessantes de desafiar o jogador. Esteja ciente de que esse tipo de conquista requer muita pr\u00e1tica, tempo e experi\u00eancia para criar.\n\n\nO jeito aqui \u00e9 ser criativo! E lembre-se de mant\u00ea-lo divertido!\n\n\nDesafios de pontua\u00e7\u00e3o\nlink\n\n\nExemplos de desafios de pontua\u00e7\u00e3o:\n\n\n\n\nCompletando um jogo ou n\u00edvel com a menor pontua\u00e7\u00e3o poss\u00edvel.\n\n\nComplete um minigame com uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o perfeita (n\u00e3o apenas no topo do ranking da CPU).\n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete o jogo com a maior pontua\u00e7\u00e3o / mais dinheiro / melhor contagem de mortes / etc. poss\u00edvel.\n\n\nLeaderboard - Complete um estagio com a maior pontua\u00e7\u00e3o / mais dinheiro / melhor contagem de mortes / etc. poss\u00edvel.\n\n\n\n\nPr\u00f3s e Contras dos desafios\nlink\n\n\nAs conquistas de desafio s\u00e3o a sua chance de mostrar aos jogadores como jogar seus jogos favoritos de maneiras diferentes, \u00fanicas e at\u00e9 alucinantes. Embora essas conquistas possam dar vida a um conjunto de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es que, de outra forma, \u00e9 mon\u00f3tono, voc\u00ea geralmente quer que apenas um pequeno grupo delas esteja na sua lista final.\n\n\nPr\u00f3s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJogadores hardcore amam deixar suas marcas nesses tipos de conquistas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe alguns jogadores s\u00e3o muito hardcore, voc\u00ea pode encontrar um meio feliz implementando o Leaderboards, que satisfaz tanto os ca\u00e7adores de conquistas ocasionais quanto os jogadores hardcore de uma s\u00f3 vez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsta \u00e9 a sua chance de ser muito criativo e criar novos desafios para jogadores que eles nunca esperaram. Isso pode ser uma surpresa agrad\u00e1vel e realmente tornar suas listas memor\u00e1veis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContras\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsses tipos de realiza\u00e7\u00f5es exigem uma boa quantidade de criatividade, embora haja muitas maneiras de pesquisar, maneiras incomuns de jogar, observando coisas como corridas de velocidade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPode exigir uma pesquisa profunda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstes podem ser notoriamente dif\u00edceis de codificar. Eles exigem que voc\u00ea fa\u00e7a muitas anota\u00e7\u00f5es de c\u00f3digo, fa\u00e7a toneladas de observa\u00e7\u00f5es mec\u00e2nicas do jogo e, muitas vezes, eles exigem testes de erros antes mesmo de funcionar. Na verdade, voc\u00ea pode nem estar pronto para enfrentar conquistas como essa at\u00e9 ter alguns jogos em seu curr\u00edculo com um conjunto de conquistas b\u00e1sicas. Felizmente, as Conquistas do Desafio sempre podem ser adicionadas mais tarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFontes externas\nlink\n\n\n\n\nBest practices achievement creation guide\n escrito por Jeff Sullivan, gerente de contas de desenvolvedor do XNA Developer Connection (XDC) sobre Conquistas do XBox 360. \ntexto em ingl\u00eas\n\n\nMake them Work for it \n, um guia de design de conquistas escrito por Darran Jamieson em 1\u00ba de janeiro de 2013. \ntexto em ingl\u00eas\n\n\nThe Achievement Machine: Understanding Xbox 360 Achievements in Gaming Practices\n - por Mikael Jakobsson \ntexto em ingl\u00eas\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2018-05-25 12:10] meleu:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-04-01 00:18] KingDice001:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-31 15:03] meleu:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-30 22:15] 7Mogami7:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-30 22:08] 7Mogami7:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-30 21:25] 7Mogami7:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-30 21:16] 7Mogami7:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-30 20:59] 7Mogami7:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-30 18:50] KingDice001:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)\n\n\n[2018-03-30 18:47] KingDice001:\n Updated Achievement Design pt_BR (markdown)",

Ou n\u00e3o tem muita coisa acontecendo na hist\u00f3ria. Neste caso, vamos dar uma olhadas em alguns exemplos BONS e RUINS disto:   Bom: Clear Stage 1. (Conclua o 1 estagio)  Ruim: Reach Stage 2. (Chegue o 2 estagio)   \u00c9 preciso um pouco mais de trabalho para codificar uma conquista em que o jogador precisa concluir a fase, em vez de simplesmente chegar a pr\u00f3xima.

Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9  menos suscet\u00edvel a problemas com jogadores que carregam save games ou savestates para ganhar conquistas em massa   Nota do tradutor: Em outras palavras: Evitar Cheats   Bom: Complete o jogo.

Enquanto as conquistas baseadas em progresso s\u00e3o frequentemente brindes, geralmente \u00e9 concordado aqui que uma conquista para come\u00e7ar o jogo \u00e9 um pouco f\u00e1cil demais, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada memor\u00e1vel para o jogador. \u00c9 apenas uma formalidade. E finalizando o jogo, no entanto, \u00e9 frequentemente a parte do jogo mais memor\u00e1vel para um jogador, e completar um jogo \u00e9 definitivamente uma conquista em si. \u00c9 uma boa pr\u00e1tica fazer essas conquistas como \"Derrote o ultimo chefe/fase e conclua o jogo\"   Bom: Conclua as fases tem\u00e1ticas de gelo, ou Conclua as cinco primeiras fases, ou Conclua as dez primeiras fases.  Ruim: Complete a fase 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (todas as conquistas separadas)   Uma das piores coisas que voc\u00ea pode fazer \u00e9 criar spams de conquistas. Jogos de Puzzles s\u00e3o not\u00e1veis por esses tipos de problemas, porque as fases s\u00e3o curtas e existem centenas delas ou mais. Como um resultado, o feed da p\u00e1gina principal fica com muitas micro-atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es, que \"spama\" as conquistas das outras pessoas para baixo e pra fora da p\u00e1gina principal rapidamente. A maneira de se mostrar mais profissional nessa quest\u00e3o \u00e9 ampliar um pouco mais as conquistas, em grupos de fases. Por exemplo, se os est\u00e1gios 1-10 s\u00e3o todas tem\u00e1ticas de fogo, e as fases 11-20 s\u00e3o tem\u00e1ticas de espa\u00e7o sideral, voc\u00ea pode criar conquistas ao redor desses temas.

Exemplos de desafios do Speedrun:   Concluindo um jogo em menos de uma hora.  Limpando um est\u00e1gio espec\u00edfico em menos de tr\u00eas minutos.  Passe o temporizador em um certo n\u00famero de segundos.  Mate 30 morcegos durante a sequ\u00eancia de fuga.  Colete 99 moedas b\u00f4nus antes que a tela b\u00f4nus desapare\u00e7a.  V\u00e1 do ponto A ao ponto B antes que o dia mude para a noite.  Leaderboard - Complete o jogo com o menor tempo poss\u00edvel.  Leaderboard - Complete um determinado est\u00e1gio com o menor tempo poss\u00edvel.   Um desenvolvedor pode querer ir ao YouTube ou Twitch e ver o qu\u00e3o r\u00e1pido as pessoas est\u00e3o terminando um jogo (E, por favor, ignore o TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Alguns corredores profissionais de velocidade s\u00e3o t\u00e3o r\u00e1pidos que o jogador t\u00edpico n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 a menor chance de competir, mas voc\u00ea deve ser capaz de encontrar um ponto m\u00e9dio entre o melhor tempo dele e o seu. E se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o consegue descobrir um bom momento para desafiar os jogadores aqui, \u00e9 para isso que os Leaderboards s\u00e3o - Transforme isso em uma competi\u00e7\u00e3o! Na verdade, alguns de seus favoritos speed-runners podem vir a este site e colocar seus tempos.  Voc\u00ea saber\u00e1 quando voc\u00ea est\u00e1 enfrentando uma conquista de press\u00e3o quando as palmas das m\u00e3os est\u00e3o suando e voc\u00ea se v\u00ea nervosamente olhando para o cron\u00f4metro. Como eu disse antes, nada grita: \"Aten\u00e7\u00e3o!\" mais alto que um cron\u00f4metro, especialmente quando os desenvolvedores come\u00e7am a tecer esse tipo de conquista com OUTROS tipos de conquistas (e at\u00e9 placares de l\u00edderes) durante uma parte cronometrada de um jogo. Os Desafios Temporizadores t\u00eam uma quantidade insana de sinergia com outros tipos de conquistas.",

Resolva um quebra-cabe\u00e7a em apenas dois movimentos.  One-hit KOs.  Jogos de baixo n\u00edvel (LLGs).  Nenhuma conquista de sucesso.  Nunca aperte em determinado bot\u00e3o durante um desafio.  Nunca perca a invencibilidade atrav\u00e9s de uma etapa inteira do Mario 3 encontrando estrelas suficientes.  Derrote um certo inimigo sem usar um certo movimento.  Alcan\u00e7ando Ganon em Legend of Zelda, sem espada.  Derrote um certo inimigo SOMENTE usando um certo movimento.  Trope\u00e7ar no caminho atrav\u00e9s de um labirinto, enquanto b\u00eabado / confuso.  Limpe o jogo com uma doen\u00e7a no status.

Nesses casos, voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 ser uma pessoa de ideias para criar maneiras novas e interessantes de desafiar o jogador. Esteja ciente de que esse tipo de conquista requer muita pr\u00e1tica, tempo e experi\u00eancia para criar.  O jeito aqui \u00e9 ser criativo! E lembre-se de mant\u00ea-lo divertido!",

Los logros son hechos por y para la comunidad. Ofrecemos varios emuladores personalizados para su uso, que detectar\u00e1n cuando hayas completado varios desaf\u00edos. Una vez que hayas iniciado sesi\u00f3n, los emuladores publicar\u00e1n los logros que hayas completado en el sitio, para que puedas verificar y comparar tu progreso con el de tus amigos.\n\n\nAqu\u00ed hay un ejemplo de RAGens, jugando Streets of Rage 2. Ver\u00e1s dos contadores de intentos de tabla de clasificaci\u00f3n (abajo a la derecha), un logro desbloque\u00e1ndose y finalmente la interfaz (Overlay, presionando ESC):\n\n\n\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 emulador necesito usar?\nlink\n\n\nLos emuladores oficiales de RetroAchievements.org son todos basados en Windows. Para otros sistemas operativos, puedes usar RetroArch. M\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n a continuaci\u00f3n:\n\n\nEmuladores oficiales de RetroAchievements.org\nlink\n\n\nDescarga el emulador de tu elecci\u00f3n en \nla p\u00e1gina de descargas\n, inicia sesi\u00f3n con tu nombre de usuario y contrase\u00f1a (s\u00ed, primero debes crearte una cuenta), luego carga una ROM \u00a1y juega!\n\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo accedo a la interfaz (Overlay) de logros?\nlink\n\n\nNormalmente, esto se configurar\u00e1 en la tecla de teclado 'ESC' o en la funci\u00f3n de pausa del juego. En la mayor\u00eda de los emuladores, un juego debe estar activo para que funcione.\n\n\nAlgunos de los emuladores ya deber\u00edan estar configurados asignando un bot\u00f3n de controlador para ver la interfaz de logros. Generalmente 'ESC' en el teclado debe activarlo, pero si deseas asignarlo a un control, aqu\u00ed hay algunos trucos para algunos de los emuladores oficiales:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPara RAVBA, ir a \nTools > Customize\n y asignar \nFilePause\n a un bot\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPara RASNES, ir a \nInput > Customize Hotkeys\n y cambiar \nPause/Overlay\n en la p\u00e1gina 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPara RANES, ir a \nConfig > Map Hotkeys\n y cambiar \nPause\n a un bot\u00f3n (\nNota\n: esto puede bloquear el emulador, es mejor hacerlo sin una ROM cargada para tener mejores oportunidades).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmulador RetroArch\nlink\n\n\nPara sistemas operativos que no sean Windows, debes usar el emulador \nRetroArch\n.\n\n\nActualmente se pueden obtener logros a trav\u00e9s de RetroArch en las siguientes plataformas:\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nMac\n\n\nAndroid (\u00a1s\u00ed, puedes conseguir logros mientras viajas con tu tel\u00e9fono Android!)\n\n\nPlayStation Vita (necesita estar pirateado con \nHENkaku\n)\n\n\nPlayStation 3\n\n\nWii U\n\n\nRaspberry Pi (Sistemas recomendados: \nRetroPie\n, \nlakka\n y \nRecalBox\n)\n\n\n\n\nSe puede obtener RetroArch en los siguientes enlaces:\n\n\n\n\nstable\n\n\nnightly\n\n\n\n\nUna vez que lo hayas instalado y hecho la configuraci\u00f3n inicial, sigue esta gu\u00eda para configurar los logros: \nhttps://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/\n\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 n\u00facleo (Core) RetroArch deber\u00eda usar?\nlink\n\n\nHay que tener en cuenta que no todos los n\u00facleos (Core) de RetroArch son compatibles con RetroAchievements. \nConsulta esta lista para ver cu\u00e1l elegir\n.\n\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo ver la insignia (Badge) cuando gano un logro en RetroArch?\nlink\n\n\nEsta funci\u00f3n fue implementada en RetroArch 1.7.7 (May/2019), aunque aun hay algunas plataformas en las que aun no funciona (como en el PS Vita). Simplemente necesitas percatarte que la opci\u00f3n de Menu Widget este habilitada (que usualmente lo esta por default).\n\n\nRetroArch/RALibretro no corre mi juego de arcade. \u00bfQue tengo que hacer?\nlink\n\n\nPrimero lo primero\n: percatate de estar utilizando el n\u00facleo de RetroArch correcto. Checa aqui cual nucleo deberias de utilizar para poder utilizar la funci\u00f3n de RetroAchievements en juegos de arcade: \nhttps://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/#arcade\n\n\nSegundo punto\n: Los ROMs de Arcade son mas complicados que los de consolas. Hay algunos conceptos y terminologias que necesitas entender y asi todo va a empezar a tener sentido. Aqu\u00ed hay un buen texto en ingles sobre este tema: \nDemystifying MAME ROMs\n.\n\n\nTip Pro\n: utiliza tu motor de b\u00fasqueda preferido para buscar un \"set de referencia\" (utilizar ROMs de manera aleatoria de diferentes fuentes es un m\u00e9todo de \"prueba y error\" y lo mas probable es que te frustres demasiado).\n\n\n\u00bfSer\u00e1 RetroAchievements compatible con PlayStation?\nlink\n\n\nRespuesta mem\u00e9tica:\n Cada vez que alguien pregunta sobre los logros de PSX, el desarrollo se retrasa un mes m\u00e1s. Asi que por favor, \n\u00a1DEJA DE PREGUNTAR!\n\n\nRespuesta corta:\n Si, lo ser\u00e1, pero aun no hay una fecha estimada para su llegada.\n\n\nRespuesta larga:\n El m\u00e9todo actual de creaci\u00f3n de logros tiene limitaciones que influyen directamente en la calidad de los logros. Los juegos de PlayStation son un poco m\u00e1s complejos que los de las consolas que ya son compatibles aqu\u00ed (excepto quiz\u00e1s, los de Nintendo 64). Y en consecuencia, los logros de los juegos de PS merecen una mayor elaboraci\u00f3n y cuidado. Todos tenemos un gran respeto por la consola de PlayStation, y esa es exactamente la raz\u00f3n por la que queremos implementar mejoras en el kit de herramientas utilizado para crear logros antes de agregar este soporte.\n\n\nNota:\n si encuentras cualquier otro sitio con logros para PlayStation, ten en cuenta que no esta asociado con RetroAchievements.\n\n\n\u00a1Mi correo electr\u00f3nico de bienvenida se ha perdido!\nlink\n\n\nLamentablemente, es sabido que algunas veces se pierde el correo electr\u00f3nico de bienvenida. Si esto sucede, inicia sesi\u00f3n con tu nombre de usuario/contrase\u00f1a con el que te registraste, luego visita tu p\u00e1gina de configuraci\u00f3n. En la parte superior, encontrar\u00e1s la opci\u00f3n de volver a enviar tu correo electr\u00f3nico de registro.\n\n\n\u00bfDonde puedo encontrar ROMs?\nlink\n\n\nAqu\u00ed no. Lamentablemente, es ilegal alojar o distribuir ROMs con derechos de autor.\n\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 mi juego no est\u00e1 cargando sus logros?\nlink\n\n\nYa sea:\n\n\n\n\nNo tiene logros.\n\n\nEs la ROM incorrecta.\n\n\n\n\nUna buena pr\u00e1ctica es verificar el tema oficial del foro del juego. Si a\u00fan no tienes una respuesta, consulta esta p\u00e1gina aqu\u00ed para m\u00e1s detalles: \nMi juego no esta cargando los logros\n.\n\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es el modo \"Hardcore\"?\nlink\n\n\nEl modo Hardcore es una caracter\u00edstica adicional para separar a los buenos jugadores de los grandes jugadores: el modo Hardcore desactiva \ntoda\n forma de salvado y cargado (savestates) en el emulador: no podr\u00e1s guardar y volver a cargar en cualquier momento. Tendr\u00e1s que completar el juego y obtener los logros la primera vez, al igual que en la consola original. En recompensa por esto, ganar\u00e1s tanto el logro est\u00e1ndar como el logro en modo Hardcore, en efecto, \u00a1ganando el doble de puntos! \u00a1Un juego que normalmente vale 400 puntos, vale 800 puntos si lo completas exitosamente en el modo Hardcore! Por ejemplo: si completas el juego por completo con 400 puntos, entonces tienes la oportunidad de ganar otros 400 en el modo Hardcore.\n\n\nSi quieres jugar con el modo Hardcore desactivado (tambi\u00e9n conocido como \"softcore\"), podr\u00e1s tener algunos problemas. M\u00e1s detalles aqu\u00ed: \nWhy you shouldn't use the load state feature\n\n\n\u00a1No obtuve este logro! (o lo obtuve en un momento equivocado)\nlink\n\n\nHay una caracter\u00edstica incorporada solo en los emuladores oficiales (no en RetroArch) que permite informar sobre logros rotos que se obtienen en el momento equivocado, o que no se obtienen del todo. Ir a \nRetroAchievements -> Report Broken Achievements\n.\n\n\nEjemplo:\n\n\n.\n\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay una forma de informar sobre logros rotos directamente a trav\u00e9s del sitio web. En la p\u00e1gina de cada logro, hay un enlace que dice \nReport an issue for this achievement\n, como en la imagen a continuaci\u00f3n:\n\n\n\n\nAgrega detalles del estado de tu juego, cu\u00e1ndo se activ\u00f3/no se activ\u00f3 el logro, en qu\u00e9 modo de juego ocurri\u00f3, d\u00f3nde estabas cuando sucedi\u00f3/no sucedi\u00f3, si reseteaste el juego recientemente, o cualquier otra cosa que creas que pueda ser relevante para el logro. Esto es necesario para nuestro sistema, para que los desarrolladores sepan d\u00f3nde esta el problema.\n\n\nComplet\u00e9 un logro dif\u00edcil pero no se activ\u00f3, \u00bfse me puede desbloquear manualmente?\nlink\n\n\nS\u00ed. Pero debes seguir los siguientes pasos:\n\n\n\n\nEnvia un ticket describiendo con detalles el problema que tuvo con el logro. \nMira la pregunta/respuesta anterior para saber c\u00f3mo enviar un ticket.\n\n\nSi el logro no se registr\u00f3 en el sitio debido a un problema de red, no es necesario que envie un ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObt\u00e9n una prueba/evidencia de que completaste el logro (\nejemplo perfecto de evidencia proporcionado por gr1nya\n). \nPruebas aceptables\n:\n\n\nCapturas de pantalla que muestran que estas jugando en Hardcore y has completado el logro.\n\n\nUn video de aquello (mucho mejor)\n.\n\n\nEjemplos de logros que has obtenido que reemplazan o superan este logro, por ejemplo, obtuviste el logro de 10.000 puntos, pero no el de 5.000 puntos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPubl\u00edcalo en el canal \n#help-me\n de nuestro \nServidor de Discord\n, mencionando a alg\u00fan @admin u otro usuario con el rol de admin, proporcionando la siguiente informaci\u00f3n:\n\n\nEn enlace a la p\u00e1gina del logro\n\n\nEn que modo estabas jugando (hardcore/softcore)\n\n\nEl enlace a la evidencia (captura de pantalla, video, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a1Yo tambi\u00e9n quiero hacer logros!\nlink\n\n\n\u00a1Es bueno escuchar eso!\n El mejor lugar para empezar es aqui: \nGetting Started as an Achievement Developer\n. Una vez que est\u00e9s familiarizado con el Memory Inspector y otros di\u00e1logos relacionados con los logros, puedes ir al resto de los \nDeveloper Docs\n.\n\n\nPor favor, no dudes en preguntar si necesitas ayuda, \u00a1no luches! Lo m\u00e1s importante es asegurarte de que est\u00e1s disfrutando lo que sea que est\u00e9s haciendo. Si no te est\u00e1s divirtiendo, no lo hagas. Pero si te sientes frustrado y quieres persistir, simplemente deja caer un mensaje en los \nforos\n o en el \nServidor de Discord\n y alguien se comunicar\u00e1 contigo en breve.\n\n\n\u00bfQue son los Puntos Blancos (White points)?\nlink\n\n\nLos puntos blancos (White points) son secundarios seg\u00fan lo dif\u00edcil que sea un logro. Explicado \nen detalle aqu\u00ed\n.\n\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 se considera hacer trampa (para el Hardcore)? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si encuentro evidencia de un tramposo?\nlink\n\n\nExplotaci\u00f3n de conjuntos de logros y alteraci\u00f3n o modificaci\u00f3n deliberada de juego, emulador, memoria, velocidad (avance r\u00e1pido) o conjunto. Cargar bater\u00edas grabadas para obtener logros fuera de lugar sin ganarlos durante el juego normal.\n\n\nSe prohiben todas las trampas de los juegos, a menos que se especifique en la descripci\u00f3n o los comentarios del logro en la p\u00e1gina del logro.\n\n\nVivimos por un c\u00f3digo de honor m\u00e1s que nada. Si encuentras evidencia de un tramposo, env\u00eda la evidencia a \nRAdmin\n, o env\u00eda un correo electr\u00f3nico a \nRAmodmail@gmail.com\n.\n\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si obtengo un logro que no gan\u00e9?\nlink\n\n\nLo mismo ocurre con no obtenerlo cuando deber\u00eda, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, querr\u00e1s crear un informe de ticket (ver arriba), dejando una explicaci\u00f3n de lo que sali\u00f3 mal. Tambi\u00e9n querr\u00e1s eliminar estos logros de tu cuenta, para que puedas tener la satisfacci\u00f3n de realmente ganarlos por ti mismo.\n\n\n\n\nRestableciendo logros no ganados.\n\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo restablecer mi contrase\u00f1a? (Si no la recuerdo)\nlink\n\n\nJusto aqu\u00ed:\n\nhttps://retroachievements.org/resetPassword.php\n\n\nEn el sitio, p\u00e1gina principal, mientras no est\u00e9 conectado:\n\n\n\n\n\u00bfPorque no puedo ver mi nueva foto de perfil?\nlink\n\n\nPresiona \nCtrl + F5\n (en la mayor\u00eda de navegadores). Algunas veces despu\u00e9s de haber cambiado tu foto de perfil (tambi\u00e9n conocido como avatar o foto de usuario) necesitas refrescar la cache de tu navegador; en la mayor\u00eda de los navegadores la manera mas r\u00e1pida de hacerlo es con \nCtrl + F5\n.\n\n\n\u00bfVoy obtener alg\u00fan privilegio si me convierto en Patreon?\nlink\n\n\nEn el sitio web vas a obtener un badge que dice \"I helped fund RA!\". En el servidor de discord vas a tener acceso a un canal dedicado. Aunque \nestamos inmensamente agradecido por los aportes de nuestros Patreons\n, no hay otro bonus aparte de esos.\n\n\nGracias a las \ncontribuciones de Patreon\n el proyecto de RetroAchievements puede pagar un servidor decente en el sitio web, correr el bot de discord y tambi\u00e9n realizar respaldos cada cierto tiempo (para recuperar informaci\u00f3n en caso de un desastre), y todo esto con una experiencia libre de anuncios. La comunidad entera le merece un gran gracias a los patreons.\n\n\n\u00bfRetroAchievements esta haciendo dinero por medio de la emulaci\u00f3n?\nlink\n\n\nNo. RetroAchievements es una comunidad de fans devotos que quieren rendirle homenaje a sus juegos favoritos creando y sacando logros! Aunque tambi\u00e9n aceptamos donaciones por medio de \nPatreon\n todo el dinero donado se utiliza para pagar los gastos de los servidores y mantener el sitio completamente libre de anuncios.

Respuesta corta:  Si, lo ser\u00e1, pero aun no hay una fecha estimada para su llegada.  Respuesta larga:  El m\u00e9todo actual de creaci\u00f3n de logros tiene limitaciones que influyen directamente en la calidad de los logros. Los juegos de PlayStation son un poco m\u00e1s complejos que los de las consolas que ya son compatibles aqu\u00ed (excepto quiz\u00e1s, los de Nintendo 64). Y en consecuencia, los logros de los juegos de PS merecen una mayor elaboraci\u00f3n y cuidado. Todos tenemos un gran respeto por la consola de PlayStation, y esa es exactamente la raz\u00f3n por la que queremos implementar mejoras en el kit de herramientas utilizado para crear logros antes de agregar este soporte.

Este incluye un rango \u00fanico del sitio basado en tu suma de puntos de logros en comparaci\u00f3n con todos los dem\u00e1s jugadores rankeados. Cualquier cuenta con puntos mayor a 0 es rankeada autom\u00e1ticamente.\n\n\nLo que es considerado como una partida justa y legitima contra lo que se considera que no es justo (cheating) en las tablas globales a ido tomando forma por la comunidad desde sus or\u00edgenes. La reglas de abajo son lo que se espera de cada jugador que participa en en el rankeado global. Cualquier indicaci\u00f3n de que un jugador no este siguiendo las reglas este puede llegar a perder el uso de las tablas globales, tambi\u00e9n conocido como el estatus \nNo Trackeado/Untracked\n.\n\n\nModo Hardcore\nlink\n\n\nEl modo Hardcore es una funci\u00f3n donde el emulador desactiva \ncompletamente\n la habilidad de estados de guardado (savestate), rebobinar (rewind) y c\u00e1mara lenta (slow motion). La \nfunci\u00f3n de fast-forward es la \u00fanica excepci\u00f3n aceptada\n.\n\n\nCuando juegas en modo hardcore los puntos que consigas valen el doble. Entonces si el set de logros tiene un valor de 400 puntos y lo terminas en modo hardcore vas a obtener 800 puntos.\n\n\nLos usuarios que se toman en serio las tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n son mas probables que consigan puntos en modo hardcore.\n\n\nNOTA\n: cuando se juega con el modo hardcore desactivado (tambi\u00e9n conocido como \"softcore\"), espera tener algunos problemas. Lee en \neste enlace porque no deber\u00edas de utilizar la funci\u00f3n de cargado de estado\n.\n\n\nNo Trackeado/Untracked\nlink\n\n\nUna cuenta \nno trackeada\n no aparece en el ranking global, sus actividades no aparecen en el feed, no se muestra con todos los dem\u00e1s usuarios que consiguieron alg\u00fan logro (en la pagina del logro) y sus entradas en las tablas de clasificaciones no son publicamente visible.\n\n\nSin embargo una cuenta \nNo Trackeada\n aun puede disfrutar de RetroAchievements y conseguir los emblemas por completar juegos.\n\n\nEste estatus fue creado para que la gente puede hacer lo que quiera con sus cuentas (como hacer trampa o compartir contenido en sus amigos/familia) sin meterse con el aspecto justo y competitivo de las tablas globales.\nAs\u00ed que, si quieres disfrutar de RetroAchievements pero no quieres competir en las tablas globales puedes solicitar que tu cuenta se deje de trackear. Simplemente manda un mensaje a RAdmin solicitandolo.\n\n\nNo Permitido\nlink\n\n\n\n\nNo utilices m\u00e9todos que alteren el c\u00f3digo del logro para desbloquearlos inmediatamente.\n\n\nNo consigas logros en una manera en la que no fueron las intenciones del desarrollador del logro.\n\n\nNo utilices archivos de guardado que no sean tuyos o fueron hechos para jugar con otras condiciones.\n\n\nDe ninguna manera modifiques el(los) archivo(s) o memoria del juego.\n\n\nNo utilices archivos de juego o programas conocidos como \"trainers\".\n\n\nNo utilices TAS (tool-assisted speedrunning), bots, o escritura compleja para conseguir logros.\n\n\nNo permitas que otra gente acceda a tu cuenta y consiga logros por ti.\n\n\nNo seas abusivo/a con los desarrolladores.\n\n\nNo crees o compartas m\u00e9todos para hacer trampa.\n\n\nNo utilices c\u00f3digos dentro del juego al menos que sea permitido por el desarrollador.\n\n\n\n\n1. No utilices m\u00e9todos que alteren el c\u00f3digo del logro para desbloquearlos inmediatamente.\nlink\n\n\nIncluso si \"tu tuviste\" que haber conseguido ese logro. Incluso si el juego estaba buggeado. Incluso si el logro esta completamente roto o removido. Cuando esto es detectado es muy probable que tu cuenta se pase a \nUntracked\n.\n\n\nEn los casos en que el logro tuvo que haberse desbloqueado pero no paso o no se registro en el sitio debido a un problema de red, deber\u00e1s de \nseguir los pasos descritos en el FAQ para solicitar un desbloqueo manual\n.\n\n\nNOTA\n: percatate de utilizar la ultima versi\u00f3n disponible para ese emulador.\n\n\n2. No consigas logros en una manera en la que no fueron las intenciones del desarrollador del logro.\nlink\n\n\nSi descubres un atajo a un logro esto es un bug. Por favor reporta este bug creando un ticket de reporte.\n\n\nTambien mira la \nregla permitida 2\n.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n \n\n\n\n\nDesbloqueaste logros terminando niveles por medio de un c\u00f3digo de selecci\u00f3n de niveles, y tiene que ser reportado/arreglado.\n\n\nTe diste cuenta que si entras y sales entre dos cuartos desbloqueas logros intencionados para progresi\u00f3n del juego.\n\n\nEncontraste un m\u00e9todo para conseguir logros de no recibir da\u00f1o contra un jefe mientras consegu\u00edas da\u00f1o en la pelea.\n\n\n\n\n3. No utilices archivos de guardado que no sean tuyos o fueron hechos para jugar con otras condiciones.\nlink\n\n\nIncluso si tu archivo esta perdido/corrupto o necesitas un archivo de guardado de cierta parte en el juego por que se te paso algo.\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nDescargar un archivo de guardado en linea.\n\n\nRogarle a un amigo que te mande su archivo de guardado por que se incendio tu casa y se perdieron todos tus archivos de la PC.\n\n\nCargar un archivo de guardado que creaste en un emulador sin soporte para RA, a uno con soporte para RA.\n\n\n\n\n4. De ninguna manera modifiques el(los) archivo(s) o memoria del juego.\nlink\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nAbrir los archivos del juegos con un editor de texto/hex y cambiar los valores a tu gusto; editar propiedades para archivos del juego de \"solo-lectura\"; etc. \n\n\nEditar las estad\u00edsticas o desbloqueables del juego, y despu\u00e9s guardar tu partida.\n\n\n\n\n5. No utilices archivos de juego o programas conocidos como \"trainers\".\nlink\n\n\nProgramas que pueden potenciar tus poderes en juegos, desbloquear modo de desarrollador, aumentar la velocidad del juego, modificar el c\u00f3digo del juego, etc.\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nUtilizar un programa trainer para lo que sea.\n\n\nUtilizar ROMs modificados para cualquier juego (estos no ni siquiera deber\u00edan de ser linkeados).\n\n\nUtilizar emuladores no-oficiales/antiguos-mods que actuan como trainers o herramientas de desarrollo/cheats.\n\n\nGame Genie / Action Replay y cualquier otra herramienta de cheats similar.\n\n\n\n\n6. No utilices TAS (tool-assisted speedrunning), bots, o escritura compleja para conseguir logros.\nlink\n\n\nEstos ya es scripting avanzado que va mas alla de tareas simples (algunas veces incluso sincronizado con la velocidad de reloj del procesador) para permitir que secciones del juegos que sean jugadas de una manera compleja/\u00fanica/o no-monotona/no-repetitiva y sin interacci\u00f3n humana alguna.\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nUtilizar TAS para completar un speedrun complicado o un logro de no morir.\n\n\nUtilizar un script complejo con funciones avanzadas.\n\n\nUtilizar scripts complejos que te completan un juego por completo o porciones grandes del juego sin ninguna interacci\u00f3n humana pero que requieren algunas acciones especiales.\n\n\n\n\n7. No permitas que otra gente acceda a tu cuenta y consiga logros por ti.\nlink\n\n\nIncluyendo tu \"hermano peque\u00f1o\" o tu \"primo\". Tu tienes que conseguir logros por ti mismo. Permitir que otra gente consiga logros en tu cuenta no esta permitido en general y si alguien hace trampa o rompe las reglas en tu cuenta tu vas a ser el responsable por sus acciones.\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nPermitir que un amigo que esta mas amaestrado en un juego complete secciones mas dif\u00edciles en un juego de single-player.\n\n\nPermitir que alguien inicie secci\u00f3n en tu cuenta para que pase alguna parte complicada de un juego por ti.\n\n\nPermitir que tu hermano peque\u00f1o trabaje en un logro de grindear por ti.\n\n\n\n\n8. No seas abusivo/a con los desarrolladores.\nlink\n\n\nPor medio del foro, Mensajes Privados, Discord, email, etc. Tienes permitido quejarte, solicitar cambios, dejar comentarios/rese\u00f1as negativas y otras criticas de manera respetuosa, pero tu das un nombre muy mal en la comunidad de cazadores de logros cuando hostigas/atacas a desarrolladores debido a lo que hicieron con los logros de su juego.\n\n\nEjemplos\n: Mandar amenazas o insultos a desarrolladores porque agregaron logros a su juego que a ti no te gusta; utilizando una agresividad extrema/excesiva mientras exiges al desarrollador que remueva cambie los logros; etc.\n\n\n9. No crees o compartas m\u00e9todos para hacer trampa.\nlink\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nEnse\u00f1arle a laguien como utilizar herramientas de hackeado de memoria.\n\n\nPostear en los foros, promoviendo un metodo para editar un archivo de juego.\n\n\nMandarle a alguien un link a una herramienta de hackeado de memoria o para programas trainer.\n\n\nEnse\u00f1arle a alguien como hacer trampa sin que se note.\n\n\nCrear un script complejo no-permitido y compartirlo inclusive si tu nunca lo utilizaste personalmente.\n\n\n\n\n10. No utilices c\u00f3digos dentro del juego al menos que sea permitido por el desarrollador.\nlink\n\n\nEl otro lado de la moneda para \npermitido 2\n. Cheat codes y modos debug no est\u00e1n permitidos mientras el desarrollador a hecho una nota en la que dice donde y cuando es permitido. Incluso si los logros son conseguibles con cheat codes este usualmente es un comportamiento no permitido, considerando que utilizaste cheats de una manera intencional, deber\u00edas de reportarlo como un bug con el sistema de tickets.\n\n\nPermitido\nlink\n\n\n\n\nFast-forward esta permitido.\n\n\nCuando dice explicitamente en la descripci\u00f3n de logro\n, cheat codes/modo dentro del juego est\u00e1n permitidos y herramientas de desarrollo/debug est\u00e1n permitidas.\n\n\nHacer uso de glitches dentro del juego, exploits, y tacticas \"cheesy\" es permitido.\n\n\nUtilizar guias/walkthroughs en linea es permitido.\n\n\nJugar juegos en co-op/competitivo con otro jugador o jugadores es permitido.\n\n\nTurbo esta permitido.\n\n\n\n\n1. Fast-forward esta permitido.\nlink\n\n\nIncluso en modo hardcore el fast-forward esta permitido, como una conveniencia de la actualidad. Es \ncasi\n un hecho de que el fast-forward ofrece una partida justa y por eso esta disponible para que todos lo utilicen.\n\n\nNOTA\n:en modo \nsoftcore\n savestates, rewind y camara-lenta tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n permitidos, pero ten en cuenta que podrias llegar a tener algunos problemas. Checa \neste link de Porque no deber\u00edas de utilizar la funci\u00f3n de cargado de estado\n.\n\n\n2. \nCuando dice explicitamente en la descripci\u00f3n de logro\n, cheat codes/modo dentro del juego est\u00e1n permitidos y herramientas de desarrollo/debug est\u00e1n permitidas.\nlink\n\n\nEste es un complemento a la \nregla no permitida numero 2\n.\n\n\nEl desarrollador de logros deber\u00eda de estar capacitado en \nproteger su trabajo para que estos no se desbloqueen f\u00e1cilmente simplemente ingresando cheat codes\n. Sin embargo, algunos retos muy cool y divertidos puedes ser creados si tomamos ventaja de los cheats. En estos casos en especifico, utilizar cheats del juego esta permitido.\n\n\nNOTA\n: si encuentras logros desbloqueables con uso de cheats y que en estos no este descrito que se puedan utilizar, considera abrir un ticket y reportarlo.\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nEn \nTetris (Game Boy)\n necesitas activar el c\u00f3digo de velocidad para conseguir el   logro \nReto de los Dioses (Challenge of the Gods)\n, donde necesitas limpiar 20 lineas en velocidad 19.\n\n\nEn \nGuerrilla War (NES)\n tienes permitido utilizar el c\u00f3digo de \"selecci\u00f3n de niveles y dificultad\" para conseguir logros donde necesitas completar stages sin acecinar a ning\u00fan reh\u00e9n.\n\n\n\n\n3. Hacer uso de glitches dentro del juego, exploits, y t\u00e1cticas \"mon\u00f3tonas\" (cheesy tactics) es permitido.\nlink\n\n\nGlitches/exploits/tacticas-mon\u00f3tonas esta permitido, \naunque los desarrolladores pueden programar sus logros para desactivarlos.\n Esto es usualmente mencionado en la descripci\u00f3n del logro.\n\n\nEsto no incluye cuando hay fallas en el c\u00f3digo del logro del desarrollador. En esos casos, por favor crea un ticket de reporte, y consigue el logro como se supone que el desarrollador quer\u00eda que se obtuviera. Tambi\u00e9n mira \nregla no permitida 2\n.\n\n\nEjemplos\n:\n\n\n\n\nTraspasar la colisi\u00f3n para evadir enemigos.\n\n\nHacer algo raro dentro del juego para \"buggearlo de cierta manera\" y consigas invisibilidad.\n\n\nConseguir items poderosos antes de lo intencionado.\n\n\nPonerte en un lugar donde los enemigos no te puedan golpear.\n\n\n\n\nEjemplos cuando los desarrolladores lo desabilitan\n: Megaman (NES) - vence a los jefes sin recibir da\u00f1o sin utilizar el glitch de pausa.\n\n\n4. Utilizar gu\u00edas/walkthroughs en linea es permitido.\nlink\n\n\nEjemplos\n: v\u00eddeo gu\u00edas de youtube; GameFAQs; soluciones de puzzles; lista de coleccionables; etc.\n\n\n5. Jugar juegos en co-op/competitivo con otro jugador o jugadores es permitido.\nlink\n\n\nJugar co-op esta permitido, \nsin embargo los desarrolladores pueden codificar sus logros para desactivarlo.\n Esto es usualmente mencionado en la descripci\u00f3n del logro.\n\n\nTambi\u00e9n mira \nregla no permitida 2\n.\n\n\nEjemplos\n: un amigo con experiencia jugando Streets of Rage o Goof Troop contigo; etc.\n\n\n6. Turbo esta permitido.\nlink\n\n\nTurbo es cuando dejas presionado solamente un bot\u00f3n y el bot\u00f3n es autom\u00e1ticamente presionado una y otra vez. Esta funci\u00f3n ya sea que esta integrada en el control, o en el emulador. En los dos de los casos esta permitido.\n\n\nEn casos en los que hay un scripting mas complejo aparte de solamente presionar un bot\u00f3n repetidamente, esto ya no esta permitido. Mira \nregla No Permitida 6\n.\n\n\nSanciones por hacer trampa\nlink\n\n\nCuando se detecte que se hace trampa, la cuenta va a ser puesta como \nUntracked\n. Hay algunos casos en donde la cuenta puede llegar a ser banneada.\n\n\nComo limpiar tu nombre y apelar el hacer trampa\nlink\n\n\nLa manera mas r\u00e1pida: Resetea todos tus puntos. Si fuiste previamente puesto como \nuntracked\n y te gustar\u00eda que se te regresara al estado normal por favor informalo con RAdmin para que tomen la acci\u00f3n necesaria.\n\n\nSi tienes maneras de demostrar que jugabas sin hacer trampa, manda un mensaje a RAdmin, pero ten en cuenta que todo el staff de RA son voluntarios y puede llegar a tomar un tiempo para que revisen tu caso.\n\n\nSi deseas tener la iniciativa de admitir que hac\u00edas trampa, esto es realmente apreciado y se toma en consideraci\u00f3n durante tu caso.\n\n\nSi necesitas ayuda\nlink\n\n\nSi alguna vez tuviste una pregunta, comentario, o sugerencias - si\u00e9ntete libre de contactar a RAdmin o al staff de RA (@mods y @admins) en el servidor de discord.\n\n\nEstas reglas ser\u00e1n corregidas cada cierto tiempo si esto es requerido.\n\n\nAgradecimientos Especiales\nlink\n\n\nEste documento esta fuertemente basado en \nlas reglas de caser\u00eda de logros de 100Pals\n.

Pero algunos usuarios no son jugadores hardcore y prefiero mantener el modo hardcore desactivado (vamos a llamar a este modo como softcore).\n\n\nAlgunas veces algunos usuarios \nreportan\n que un logro no se desbloqueo, y cuando se les pregunta dicen que estaban jugando en softcore.\n\n\nUna cosa que tienes que tener en cuenta es:\n\n\n\n\nSi utilizas la funci\u00f3n de cargar estado espera tener problemas con los logros cuando no se disparan cuando se suponia que se ten\u00edan que disparar.\n\n\n\n\nAhora vamos a intentar explicar para aquellos que no est\u00e1n muy familiarizados con los detalles sobre el desarrollo de logro y por que este tipo de problema ocurre.\n\n\nConcepto B\u00e1sico detr\u00e1s de un logro\nlink\n\n\nT\u00e9cnicamente un logro es un grupo de condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas en un frame en particular dentro del v\u00eddeo juego.\n\n\nCuando abres un juego en un emulador con la funci\u00f3n de RetroAchievements integrada, el emulador esta siempre revisando si las condiciones son cumplidas en el frame actual. Cuando todas las condiciones en el ese logro en particular son cumplidas, el logro es otorgado y el emulador deja de revisar si las condiciones para ese logro.\n\n\nEjemplos de condiciones:\n\n\n\n\nla barra de vida esta llena\n\n\nla barra de vida se bajo\n\n\nse tienen 9 vidas\n\n\nactualmente estas en el stage 3\n\n\nen la pantalla de titulo del juego\n\n\nse esta empezando una boss fight\n\n\nel juego esta pausado\n\n\n\n\nEl problema con softcore es que cuando cargas un estado de guardado puedes arruinar la l\u00f3gica detr\u00e1s del logro.\n\n\nEjemplos\nlink\n\n\nEjemplo 1: Completa el juego sin utilizar passwords\nlink\n\n\nImag\u00ednate un juego con 5 stages y con la funci\u00f3n de password.\n\n\nTal vez las condiciones para que el logro \"Completa el juego sin utilizar passwords\" salte son (en un logro de verdad por lo general hay mas condiciones, pero para esta explicaci\u00f3n vamos a considerar solamente estas):\n\n\n\n\nestar en stage 1 (y memoriza este evento como algo que paso)\n\n\nestar en stage 2 (memorizatelo)\n\n\nestar en stage 3 (memorizatelo)\n\n\nestar en stage 4 (memorizatelo)\n\n\nestar en stage 5 (memorizatelo)\n\n\ncompleta el stage 5\n\n\n\n\nEntonces para conseguir este logro lo que necesitas es estar en todos los niveles al menos alguna vez y completar el juego.\n\n\nCuando estas en el stage 1, el emulador lo recuerda, y lo mismo para todos los dem\u00e1s stages. Y cuando terminas el stage 5 (completa el juego) obtienes el logro.\n\n\nAhora imag\u00ednate este escenario:\n\n\n\n\nun jugador softcore empez\u00f3 el juego y jugo los stages 1, 2 y 3\n\n\nel necesitaba dejar de jugar cuando se encontraba en el stage 4 y entonces guardo un estado para continuar despu\u00e9s\n\n\ncerro el emulador\n\n\ndespu\u00e9s el pod\u00eda jugar de nuevo, empez\u00f3 el juego y cargo el estado que hab\u00eda guardado\n\n\njugo los stages 4, 5 y completo el juego\n\n\n\n\nEn este escenario el logro no saldr\u00eda.\n\n\nDespu\u00e9s de cerrar el emulador el \"olvida\" lo que paso en los stages 1, 2 y 3.

Entonces el logro no se va a desbloquear.\n\n\nEjemplo 2: Derrota al jefe X sin recibir da\u00f1o\nlink\n\n\nLo mas probable es que la condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas para que este logro salte son:\n\n\n\n\nentra al cuarto del jefe (y memoriza este evento como algo que paso).\n\n\nsi se toma da\u00f1o, olvida que se entro al cuarto del jefe.\n\n\nderrota al jefe.\n\n\n\n\nEn otras palabras: para obtener este logro el emulador tiene que \"saber\" que entraste al cuarto del jefe, que no obtuviste ning\u00fan da\u00f1o, y que venciste al jefe.\n\n\nEl detalle importante en el que tenemos que prestar atenci\u00f3n es: cuando recibes alg\u00fan da\u00f1o, el emulador \"olvida\" que entraste al cuarto del jefe.

Sigue las \nreglas de reservacion\n tambien.\n\n\nEspera 3 dias despues que hubieras \nposteado tus planes\n para promober cualquiera de los logros a core.\n\n\nManten tu trabajo libre de \nconceptos-no bienvenidos\n.\n\n\nUsa \ncodigo protectivo\n para prevenir cheating y exploits potenciales.\n\n\nDeja \nnotas de codigo\n precisas para cada condicion de logro que utilices.\n\n\nPara revisiones de set, sigue la \npolitica de revision\n.\n\n\nResuelve tickets\n, y deja notas cada vez que lo hagas.\n\n\nUna vez que publiques tu trabajo, estas dejando que la comunidad \nrese\u00f1e y lo retrabaje a traves del tiempo\n.\n\n\n\n\nAntes de empezar\nlink\n\n\nEstas libre de tickets?\nlink\n\n\nAntes que trabajes en nuevos juegos tienes que resolver todos los tickets con los que cuentes. Una vez que estes libre tickets, entonces adelante.\n\n\nEl juego esta presente en la base de datos?\nlink\n\n\nNo\nlink\n\n\nEntonces pregunta para que sea agregado por medio de Discord \n#help-me\n o en nuestros foros para que algun desarrollador lo agregue por ti. Es esencial que tu \nelijas el ROM(s) correcto para trabajar\n. Si quieres trabajar en un hack, checa \nlogros para hacks de ROM\n doc first.\n\n\nSi\nlink\n\n\nBien! adelante.\n\n\nEl juego ya cuenta con un set de logros?\nlink\n\n\nYes\nlink\n\n\nSi existe un set, no te rindas. Aun lo puede mejorar, agregando/removiendo/re-trabajando logros, o haz cambios a titulos e imagenes, etc. Sin embargo tendras que pasar por el \nproceso de revision de tu set\n.\n\n\nNo\nlink\n\n\nBusca delicadamente. Algunas veces hay multiples entradas en la base de datos para el mismo juego con diferente titulos. Una vez que este seguro, ahora necesitas checar si hay otro desarrollador trabajando en el juego.\n\n\nNota:\n Solo un set de logros es permitido por el mismo juego y consola. Para detalles mira \ntrabajando con el ROM correcto\n.\n\n\nHay otros desarrollor trabajando en el juego?\nlink\n\n\nPara estar seguro que no hay otro desarrollador trabajando en ese juego, checa el foro oficial del juego (esa es la manera oficial de \nreservar el juego en el que quieres trabajar\n). Esto es necesario para evadir conflictos entre multiples desarrolladores trabajando en el mismo juego.\n\n\nSi\nlink\n\n\nPodria ser posible que el desarrollor hubiera dejado de trabajar en ellos. Se espera que el desarrollador renueve su reservacion cada dos meses. Mira en las etiquetas de tiempo para ver cuando el desarrollador postio su reservacion de desarrollo. Si el desarrollador no a clarificado o renovado su reservacion despues de que hubieran pasado dos meses puedes asumir que fue abandonado y asi postear tus planes de trabajo.\n\n\nNo\nlink\n\n\nPerfecto! Adelante! El siguiente paso es anunciar tus planes para desarrollar logros para el juego.\n\n\nAnunciando tus planes para trabajar en un juego\nlink\n\n\nAnunciar tus planes para el set de logros se hace en el foro oficial del juego del que tienes en mente crear el set.\n\n\nPostear tus planes es tu manera de reservar oficialmente un juego, sin embargo hay algunas \nreglas sobre el apartado sets\n que tienes que tener en cuenta.\n\n\nNotas Importantes\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo hay necesidad de que dejes un plan completo y detallado!\n Simplemente una idea general de cuales son tus intenciones (tus planes son muy probables que cambien una vez que hubieras investigado la memoria del juego). Haz esto para que la comunidad pueda dejar recomendaciones y puede proveer retroalimentacion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntenta estar abierto a recomendaciones. Si no estas de acuerdo con la retroalimentacion recivida, puedes continuar con tu concepto. Pero recuerda tener lo siguiente en mente:\n\n\n\n\nTienes que aderirte al \nReglamento de Dise\u00f1o Basico de Logros\n, de otra manera tu set no sera aprovado.\n\n\nCuando tu publicas tu trabajo estas dejando a la comunidad para que sea rese\u00f1ado y re-trabajado sobre el paso del tiempo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi alguien escogio un juego del cual tu estas interesado antes que tu, no te desesperes. Te animamos a solicitar una colaboraci\u00f3n. Puedes publicar tu deseos de colaborar en el foro o mandar un mensaje al desarrollador para obtener permiso para que publique tus contribuciones. Tambien puedes esperar e ir por una \nRevision de Set\n after the set is published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReglas para reservar juegos para desarrollo\nlink\n\n\nLas siguientes reglas existen para saber facilmente quien esta trabajando en que, definir que es aceptable, prevenir que el desarrollo de juegos no se estanque, proteger a los desarrolladores de indebida presion social.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa unica manera de reservar un juego es posteando tu plan en el foro oficial del juego en un nuevo post\n.\n\n\n\n\nNo otros planes o listas posteadas en cualquier otro luegar son consideradas en esto.\n\n\nNotas de codigo no reservan un juego (si agregaste notas pero no reservaste el juego en el foro, cualquier desarrollador es libre de trabajar en el).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumero maximo de juegos reservados a la vez:\n\n\n\n\nDesarrollador Junior\n: 1.\n\n\nDesarrollador\n: 4.\n\n\nDesarrollador Veterano\n: 8 (un Desarrollador Veterano es alguien que a sido un desarrollador por minimo 18 meses \ny\n a publicado un minimo de 20 sets de logros).\n\n\nNota:\n Trabajar en una revision aprovada o unirte con otro desarrollador en un esfuerzo cooperativo no cuenta para este total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolo reserva un juego para desarrollo cuando realmente ya vaz a empezar a trabajar en el. En otras palabras, no reserves juegos simplemenete para blockear otros usuarios en trabajar en ellos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuedes renovar tu reservacion cada dos meses (+/- 2 semanas) si no haz terminado tu set aun.\n\n\n\n\nPara renovar tu reservacion, postealo en el foro oficial del juego.\n\n\nNo edites tus antiguas declaraciones, haz un nuevo post hablando del progreso actual.\n\n\nEvita ignorar un set indefinidamente. Si parece que un desarrollador continua retrasando el desarrollo de un set con poco o sin progreso el staff puede intervenir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo pidas, presiones o desalentes a nadie en trabajar en cualquier juego, en publico o en privado (claramente, asumiendo que la persona esta siguiendo todos los otros estandartes de este Codigo de Conducta).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUna vez que hubieras posteado tu plan, \nespera un minimo de \n72 hours\n antes de promover cualquier logro a Core\n. Esto le da tiempo a la comunidad de renovar tu plan y dar retro-alimentacion. Este periodo de espera empieza despues que tu plan este presente y esta en su forma completa (o mayormente completa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReglamento de Dise\u00f1o Basico de Logros\nlink\n\n\nConceptos No-Bienvenidos\nlink\n\n\nTu puedes (y deberias) se lo mas creativo que puedas, pero hay algunos conceptos que \nNO\n estan bienvenidos para logros, como:\n- Requirir el uso de glitches (aceptable en \nSets Bonus\n).\n- Requieren dos jugadores.\n- Requiere perfeccion por todo el juego (\ntalvez\n aceptable in \nSets Bonus\n).\n- Morir (simplemente), o juega mal sin ningun proposito.\n- Contenido no apropiado (NSFW) en la imagen o texto.\n- Logros saltando frecuentemente con poco esfuerzo del jugador (incluyendo multiples logros por hacer la misma tarea, como vencer al jefe y otro por conseguir el item que dejo el jefe , etc.)\n- Logros obtenibles con zero esfuerzo sin razon alguna (ejemplo: empieza el juego con x personaje, colecciona una moneda). Es acceptable si hay algo divertido/historico/interesante que quieres tocar.\n- Se requiere grinding repetitivo y excesivo, asi como llega a level 99 en un RPG, sin razon alguna (\ntalvez\n aceptable en \nSets Bonus\n).\n- Se basa completamente en suerte, especialmente cuando hay probabilidades realmente bajas. Sin embargo, para juegos que el factor aleatorio es un aspecto importante, podria ser apropiado.\n- \"Logros Secretos\", cuando los jugadores no tiene indicacion de que es lo que tienen que hacer. Si quieres prevenir spoilers da minimo una pista en el titulo o descripcion. De otra manera los jugadores van a empezar a buscar en la web o van a moverle al editor de Logros/Inspector de Memoria, y en el proceso pueden incluso toparse con peores spoilers.\n\n\nCon cada regla, hay un excepcion. Esta es especialmente verdad con conceptos no-bienvenidos. Todos los conceptos no-bienvenidos tienen un margen de aprovacion. cuando te encuentres en dudas puedes consultar con el equipo de administradores.\n\n\nCada Set de logros TIENE que tener\nlink\n\n\nProteccion\n para situaciones donde los jugadores puedes conseguir logros sin esfuerzo, como:\n\n\n\n\nModo Demo;\n\n\nCheat codes en el juego;\n\n\nArchivos de guardado;\n\n\nPasswords.\n\n\n\n\nTambien mira\n: \nPlantillas para logros\n y \nEjemplos reales\n para algunas tecnicas de proteccion bien conocidas.\n\n\nCada Set de logros DEBERIA tener\nlink\n\n\n\n\nMinimo \nRich Presence\n basico; \n\n\nMedallas (Badges) para cada Logro; \n\n\nTodo la informacion del juego llena, e imagenes del juego subidas.\n\n\n\n\nNota\n: Rich Presence, Tablas de clasificacion, y paginas del juego imagenes/informacion solo pueden ser agregadas por verdaderos desarrolladores\n\n\nRecomendado pero no requerido por cada Set de logros\nlink\n\n\n\n\nTablas de clasificacion para puntajes y retos de tiempo.\n\n\nLogros Perdidisos flageados, especialmente para RPGs y juegos largos. \n\n\nUtiliza \n[m]\n al final del titulo del logro para flaggearlo como perdidiso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUna guia de logros. Guias pueden ser creadas y posteadas \naqui\n. \n\n\n\n\nHerramientas para ayudarle a tener \u00e9xito\nlink\n\n\nTenemos un We have a \nmapa\n que puedes utilizar como guia para crear un buen set de logros.\nTambien tenemos una \nguia de dise\u00f1o de logros\n en como dise\u00f1ar buenos logros, no el lado tecnico pero si el conceptual. Crear un set balanceado es uno de los aspectos mas dificiles de desarrollo, tenemos una \nguia de balance de dificultad\n que te podria ayudar en pensar como crear un set que fluya.\n\n\nEs preferible y recomendado trabajar en un set a la vez. Pero si tienes mas, ten abiertas posibilidades para trabajar en equipo o incluso delegar la creacion de un set si otro desarrollador te contacta.\n\n\nRevisiones - Trabajando en Sets que ya cuentan con logros\nlink\n\n\nRevisiones, si estas trabajando en un set que ya cuenta con logros tipicamente requiere aprovacion por la comunidad, presentando tu plan en el foro y en el canal de \n#revision-voting\n en Discord. No todos los cambios requieren aprovacion. Mira \nRevisiones de Sets de Logros\n para mas detalles.\n\n\nNotas de Codigo\nlink\n\n\nDeja notas precisas para cada valor que utilizes en un logro. Esto te ayuda a ti y a otros de mantener el set libre de bugs.\n\n\nEres libre de agregar todos las notas que quieras en el juego sin incluso a ver declarado tus intenciones en trabajar en ese juego. Simplemente se cuidadoso en no borrar notas de codigo creadas por otros usuarios.\n\n\nManejo de Tickets\nlink\n\n\nDespues que hubieras publicado tus logros preparate para reportes de bugs.\n\n\nSe supone que tienes que dejar tu trabajo libre de bugs con el manejo de tickets y resolviendolos. Responde a todos los tickets lo mas pronto posible. Mientras mas pronto mejor, porque el problema esta fuera de la mente del jugador y puedes utilizarlo como ayuda para resolver el problema tambien.\n\n\nMientras resuelves tickets, deja un peque\u00f1o resumen de lo que hiciste. Si tienes una indicacion o un reporte falso deja un mensaje cuales fueron tus conclusiones, y entonces cierra el ticket. \nCerrar/Resolver un ticket sin dejar ningun comentario es una actitud no-bienvenida.\n\n\nNo declares tus planes de trabajar en un juego si cuentas con tickets abiertos.\n\n\nSi tienes planeado resolver tickets o arreglar bugs en logros hechos por otro desarrollador, siempre es una buena practica intentar contactarlo si aun se encuentra activo antes de modificar su trabajo. \nUn desarrollador inactivo es alguien que cuenta con 10 o mas tickets abiertos y tienen un minimo de dos meses de antiguedad\n (puedes ver sus tickets abiertos desde el Ticket Manager).\n\n\nSi el desarrollador esta activo, puedes simplemente hecharle una ayuda con la solucion.\n\n\nSi el desarrollador esta inactivo puedes libremente resolverle sus tickets. Sin embargo solamente tienes permitido arreglar el logro con lo que dice en su descripcion; \nno cambies la intencion de logro sin haber pasado por el proceso de revision\n.\n\n\nPropiedad de los logros\nlink\n\n\nCuando tu publicas tu trabajo tu se lo estas dando a la comunidad\n para que sea rese\u00f1ado y re-trabajado con el paso del tiempo - mira \nRevisiones en un Set\n. \n\n\nAunque los logros publicados por un desarrollador no son propiedad de el, el aun es el encargado en terminos de arreglar y dar mantenimiento. Si otro jugador corrige el logro el es el nuevo encargado de ese logro.\n\n\nRetroalimentacion sobre el Codigo de Conducta del Desarrollador\nlink\n\n\nA pesar de que el Codigo de Conducta del Desarrollador es el resultado de un intenso debate, no es un documento absoluto.

            "text": "Bienvenido al mundo de Creacion de Logros!\n\n\nConceptos Basicos\nlink\n\n\nTecnicamente \nun logro es un grupo de condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas en un punto particular en un video juego\n.\n\n\nCuando abres un juego en un emulador con las funciones de RetroAchievements, el emulador esta siempre checando si esas condiciones se cumplen en el punto exacto. Cuando todas las condiciones de un logro en particular son cumplidas, se dispara el logro y el emulador deja de checar las condiciones para ese logro.\n\n\nEl proceso de creaci\u00f3n de un logro basicamente se divide en 3 pasos:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncontar un lugar en la Memoria RAM del juego donde se almacene la informacion que buscas (ejemplos: nivel, barra de vida, tiempo, monedas, sacar un arma, obtener un item, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrear las condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas para que se dispare el logro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbar si tu logro funciona como es debido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa mayoria de las veces vaz a tener que volver al punto 2 y 3 muchisimas veces para refinar la logica de tu logro.\n\n\nEn este documento vamos a ver como lograr los pasos de arriba.\n\n\nUna vez que estes seguro que tu logro esta saltando con las condiciones que tu quieres, puedes subirlo al servidor. Vamos a ver mas sobre eso en un momento.\n\n\nPrimeros Pasos\nlink\n\n\nAntes que nada necesitas estar seguro que tienes un emulador de RA de la \npagina de descargas de RetroAchievements\n y tambien haberte \ncreado una cuenta\n para poder iniciar seccion en el emulador.\n\n\nEn esta guia vamos a utilizar RAGens como demostracion, y el juego \nSonic the Hedgehog\n. Estamos utilizando RAGens pero lo mismo aplica para cualquier otro emulador.\n\n\nPara empezar abre el ejecutable de RAGens, e inicia seccion cuando salga la venta de inicio. Siguiente, ve a File -> Open y selecciona el ROM del que quieres trabajar los logros.\n\n\nInspector de Memoria\nlink\n\n\nAhora deberias tener en tu ventana principal corriendo Sonic. Hay otras 3 ventanas que vamos a estar utilizando, que se pueden encontrar sobre la pesta\u00f1a de \nRetroAchievements\n en el menu. Vamos a trabajar con el \nInspector de Memoria\n primero:\n\n\n\n\nEl inspector de memoria se puede utilizar para encontrar variables en la RAM que podamos utilizar. Esencialmente estas en una caseria de tesoros por encontrar los lugares en memoria - esta ventana te ayudara a examinar y filtrar la RAM del juego que se encuentra corriendo.\n\n\nNOTA: Si deseas un video paso por paso explicando como encontra valores en la memoria, \neste viejo video\n puede llegar a ser util\n.\n\n\nTambien mira\n: \nUn vistaso al Inspector de Memoria\n y \nTips en la busqueda de Memoria\n.\n\n\nPara empezar o reiniciar una prueba, haz click en \nNew 8-bit Test\n en la parte casi superior del medio.\n\n\nPara manter las cosas simple, vamos a empezar a buscar el valor en memoria que guarda el numero de anillos que hemos recolectado. Nuestros pasos son los siguientes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarga el ROM y empieza una nueva partida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResetea la ventana de memoria: Haz click en \nNew 8-bit Test\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegresa al juego y cambia el numero de anillos en la memoria. Por ejemplo, colecciona un anillo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn la ventana de memoria, ahora vamos a filtrar los valores que son 'mas grandes que los antiguos valores' (simbolo \n>\n). Seleccionamos esto y, entonces hacemos click en \nFilter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuando ya estes haciendo esto por una 3ra y 4ta vez, el numero de posibilidades o 'candidatos' va a ir disminuyendo. Vamos a seguir haciendo esto asta que lleguemos a un numero muy peque\u00f1o (el mas peque\u00f1o que sea posible), puede llegar a tomar entre 4-5 intentos. Ahora podemos hacer click en la ventana de resultados, y monitoriar los valores en memoria, hasta abajo en el visor de memoria. Continua en el juego y deberias de ver como los valores en la memoria cambian cada vez que coleccionas anillos. Si no es asi, o si algo no se ve bien, intenta otro valor. Con el primer Sonic the Hedgehog, el valor en memoria para el numero de anillos deberia de ser \n0xfe20\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNota 1\n: Utilizando estados de guardados (save states)(F5 para salvar un estado, F8 para cargar un estado, F6-F7 para cambiar que estados utilizar), puedes brincar entre estados de guardado permitiendo esto alterar la RAM, y utilizarlo para filtrar malos candidatos. Puedes buscar resultados que permanescan iguales (Es decir si es que sabes que un valor no tuvo que haber cambiado, utiliza \n=\n), o para valores que son diferentes (utiliza 'no igual', simbolo \n!=\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNota 2\n: Afortunadamente no hay una garantia de un juego a otro para saber como los desarrolladores almacenaban la informacion (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, decimales con codigo binario, negativo/invertido. Por ejemplo utilizando 0xff/0xffff para representar 'fijo', o algo completamente aleatorio), pero eventualmente deberias de encontrarte con varios buenos valores. Nota si estas batallando en encontrar buenos valores, postea en el \nForo de Ayuda de RetroAchievements.org\n, o en el \nServidor de Discord de RetroAchievements\n. Hay bastante gente que estaria dispuesta en ayudarte con mucho gusto!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n: Si te gusta experimentar con la memoria, intenta ingresar valores directamente en el visor de la RAM. Esto puede causar efectos devastadores en un juego, o podria hacer exactamente lo que deseas que pase, (o inclusive nada!) De todos modos podria ser util, ver si ingresas un valor y paso el resultado que esperas. Utilizalo con cuidado!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuando encuentres un valor del que te sientes feliz con el, puedes escriber una peque\u00f1a nota de lo que es haciendo click en \nSave Note\n, esto lo va a guardar en la base de datos, y va a ser automaticamente cargado la siguiente vez que cargues el visor de memoria para ese juego, donde sea que te encuentres! Nota despues que haces click en 'Save Note', la nota va a ser automaticamente guardada en la base de datos y compartida, la cual todos los desarrolladores tendran acceso a ella. Todos van a descargar esa nota cuando carguen su ROM. Si intentas sobre-escribir una nota, te va a salir una ventana de confirmacion antes de guardarla.\n\n\nPuedes encontrar mas utiles \nTips en Busqueda de Memoria aqui\n.\n\n\nSets de Logros\nlink\n\n\nOk asi que el valor en memoria para el numero de anillos se encuentra almacenado en \n0xfe20\n - nota para un no-programador, estamos manejando numeros en el \nsistema numerico Hexadecimal\n que puede llegar a ser desalentador, pero no te preocupes, esencialmente simplemente son numeros y letras en vez de solo numeros, y no olvides \n0x\n al principio para mostrar que es un valor en memoria en hexadecimal. Hemos encontrado un valor en el que estamos interesado y lo hemos guardado con \nSave Note\n. Ahora queremos crear un nuevo logro.\n\n\nVe a la pesta\u00f1a de \nRetroAchievements\n en el menu de tu emulador, escoje \nAchievement Sets\n y vas a ver esta ventana:\n\n\n\n\nAqui agrupamos todos los logros disponibles en tres sets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogros Core (los principales, set publico de logros),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnofficial/User Achievements (publicos, pero no otorgan puntos: para revision),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Achievements (personales, en tu PC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn la venta de Logros, haz click en \nLocal Achievements\n (superior izquierda), luego en \nAdd New Achievement\n (superior derecha). Esto va a\u00f1adir una entrada vacia en la lista del centro. Haz doble click en ella: si aun no esta abierta, esto deberia de abrir la ventana del \nAchievement Editor\n (editor de logros).\n\n\nEditor de Logros\nlink\n\n\nA si es como se ve:\n\n\n\n\nEsta es la ventana final en la que vamos a poner toda la informacion junta. La mayoria de los campos de arriba se explican solos, ejemplo: Titulo, Descripcion, Puntos. La principal seria la parte de 'Requisitos'\n\n\nVamos a decir que queremos agregar un logro por coleccionar cierto numero de anillos. Vamos a decir 15 por simplicidad. Despues de llenar los campos de arriba y a ver seleccionado un icono apropiado (en este ejemplo estamos utilizando la medalla del trofeo dorado (00136), pero tu puedes subir una nueva), ocupamos llenar los requisitos. Tenemos un requisito, \nese numero de anillos tiene que ser minimo 15\n. El siguiente click seria en \nAdd New Requirement\n.\n\n\nClickear este boton va a agregar algunos valores por default a la lista de requisitos. Los valores por defaults simplemente se percatan que algo relativamente sensible se agrego a la lista. Por ahora, ignorando el campo 'Special?'. Cuando clickeamos en crear, el valor default en memoria va a ser el ultimo valor que dejaste en la ventana de memoria.\n\n\nLo siguiente seria cambiar estos valores a los siguientes:\n\n\n\n\nSize\n: \n16-bit\n\n\nMemory\n: \n0xfe20\n\n\nCmp\n: \n>=\n - esta es la comparacion que vamos a hacer. Podemos tener cualquier comparacion aqui, pero es sencible que tengas un \"mayor que e igual a\". Esto es importante porque si tenemos 10 anillos y despues obtenemos 10 anillos de una caja de 10 anillos vamos a tener 20, y vamos a perder el logro ya que tendriamos que tener \nexactamente\n 15 anillos.\n\n\nType\n: \nValue\n - estamos comparando este valor en memoria con un valor fijo: 15\n\n\nSize\n: \nEmpty\n - Esto es solamente relevante cuando estemos comparando valor en memoria con otro valor en memoria\n\n\nMem/Val\n: \n15\n - el numero de anillos requirido: el valor del que estamos comparando la memoria\n\n\nHit Count\n: \n0\n - ignora esto por ahora, es util cuando necesitas que algo paso un cierto numero de veces\n\n\n\n\nCon esto establecido, no necesitamos ninguna otra condicion que agregar, asi que podemos regresar a \nAchievements Dialog\n (Ventana de Logros). Para estar seguros, tenemos que guardar nuestro progreso presionando \nSave Local\n! Esto guarda todo localmente para asegurar que no perdamos ningun progreso.\n\n\n\n\nNota\n: usualmente un logro tiene mas de un requisito para evadir que salte en un momento equivocado (por ejemplo: jugando en modo demo). En este ejemplo estamos utilizando solamente un requisito para simplificar la explicacion. Mira mas \nTips en la Creacion de Logros aqui\n.\n\n\n\n\nProbando el logro\nlink\n\n\nAhora podemos 'activar' este logro localmente presionando en \nActivate\n a mano derecha de la ventana. Esto va a empezar a monitoriar estos valores en memoria y va a entregar el logro una vez que todas las condiciones se hubieran cumplido de manera verdadera. Ahora podemos avanzar y probar si este logro sirve!\n\n\n\n\nSi presionamos \nEsc\n mientras jugamos, vas a ver como se miraria el logro desde la interfaz de RetroAchievements!\n\n\n\n\nA pesar de que el logro funciono bien en nuestras pruebas, un logro con una logica como esa no esta listo para ser oficialmente lanzado. Primero que nada: tiene una sola condicion: \"anillos coleccionados >= 15\". El problema es que ese mismo valor es el mismo que se utiliza para almacenar el numero de anillos cuando el juego corre en \"modo demo\" (Cuando la computadora juega el juego automaticamente cuando duras mucho tiempo en la pantalla de titulo). A si que, si Sonic colecciona 15 anillos en modo demo el logro tambien saldria, que es algo que no queremos.\n\n\nCheca los tips en la siguiente seccion de abajo para conocer como mejorar la logica de tu logro y hacerlo aceptable para que sea oficialmente lanzado.\n\n\nTips Importantes\nlink\n\n\nAqui estan algunos tips que tienes que tener en mente cuando te encuentres creando logros:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNunca\n Evade hacer logros con una sola condicion lo mas que puedas\n. De otra manera es muy probable que el logro se dispare en una parte no deseada. Este es el \nerror mas comun por un desarrollador\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi el juego tiene un \nmodo demo\n (El CPU juega despues que esperas un tiempo en la pantalla de titulo), percatate de \nencontrar el valor para eso\n y agrega una condicion para que tus logros no se disparen en modo demo. Tambien necesitas saber como utilizar \nPauseIf\n y \nResetIf\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf\n cheat codes\n: Si el juego tiene un cheat para aumentar vidas, seleccionar niveles, etc. Percatate de encontrar el valor para eso y agregar algo de proteccion en tus logros. OK, talvez no es un tema muy sencillo, pero es algo que tienes que tener en cuenta cuando estes creando un set oficial de logros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvita crear logros de simplemente llegar a un nivel.\n Esto puede ser conseguido por medio de un password o un cheat. Mejor haz logros por terminar un nivel, \ncomo en la plantilla de aqui\n. Tambie, \nno hagas logros por simplemente empezar un juego o \"empieza el juego con X personaje\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi quieres crear un logro por conseguir un item especifico y unico, agrega algunas condiciones para estar seguro que el jugador obtuvo el item donde se suponia que se tenga que obtener, \ncomo en esta plantilla de aqui\n. De otra manera el logro podra ser conseguible utilizando un codigo o cargando una partida de cargado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvita hacer muchos logros sobre simples cosas que necesitan casi cero esfuerzo\n. Ejemplos de que \nNO\n tienes que hacer: obten una moneda o un hongo en Super Mario Bros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen encuenta los \nconceptos no-bienvenidos en el dise\u00f1o de logros\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe creativo con tus logros\n. Esos que abarcan caracteristicas y detalles unicos son los mas bienvenidos. Los jugadores aman cuando un peque\u00f1o detalle de un juego que aman es apoyado por un logro. Leer un Walkthrough en \nGameFAQs\n te puede dar un poco de inspiracion tambien.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntentar pasar la mayor cantidad de tiempo posible con el juego, especialmente si es la primera vez que desarrollas logros. Toma mas tiempo conocer el juego por dentro, trabajar con la memoria funciona ya que es la mejor fuente de ideas para logros unicos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuedes encontrar mas en la \npagina de Tips y Trucos\n.\n\n\nSiguientes pasos\nlink\n\n\nAhora que ya sabes como utilizar el Inspector de Memoria, y el Editor de Logros. Llego la hora de que aprendas nuevas tecnicas y practiques:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn orden que refines la logica de tus logros, puedes ver con que funciones cuentas en la pagina de \nFunciones en la Logica de los Logros\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuedes aprender viendo logros existentes que otros desarrolladores han hecho con una explicacion extra en la pagina de \nEjemplos Reales\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTambien puedes ver algunos ejemplos genericos en la pagina de \nPlantillas para Logros\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUna vez que hubieras aprendido todas las tecnicas basicas, si quieres obtener el estatus de Desarrollador tienes que seguir los pasos explicados aqui: \nComo convertirme en un desarrollador de logros\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQue te diviertas!\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-04-16 15:36] meleu:\n fix broken links\n\n\n[2019-03-12 14:58] meleu:\n Updated Getting Started as an Achievement Developer ES (markdown)",

Cuando abres un juego en un emulador con las funciones de RetroAchievements, el emulador esta siempre checando si esas condiciones se cumplen en el punto exacto. Cuando todas las condiciones de un logro en particular son cumplidas, se dispara el logro y el emulador deja de checar las condiciones para ese logro.  El proceso de creaci\u00f3n de un logro basicamente se divide en 3 pasos:    Encontar un lugar en la Memoria RAM del juego donde se almacene la informacion que buscas (ejemplos: nivel, barra de vida, tiempo, monedas, sacar un arma, obtener un item, etc.).    Crear las condiciones que tienen que ser cumplidas para que se dispare el logro.    Probar si tu logro funciona como es debido.    La mayoria de las veces vaz a tener que volver al punto 2 y 3 muchisimas veces para refinar la logica de tu logro.  En este documento vamos a ver como lograr los pasos de arriba.

            "text": "Ahora deberias tener en tu ventana principal corriendo Sonic. Hay otras 3 ventanas que vamos a estar utilizando, que se pueden encontrar sobre la pesta\u00f1a de  RetroAchievements  en el menu. Vamos a trabajar con el  Inspector de Memoria  primero:   El inspector de memoria se puede utilizar para encontrar variables en la RAM que podamos utilizar. Esencialmente estas en una caseria de tesoros por encontrar los lugares en memoria - esta ventana te ayudara a examinar y filtrar la RAM del juego que se encuentra corriendo.  NOTA: Si deseas un video paso por paso explicando como encontra valores en la memoria,  este viejo video  puede llegar a ser util .  Tambien mira :  Un vistaso al Inspector de Memoria  y  Tips en la busqueda de Memoria .  Para empezar o reiniciar una prueba, haz click en  New 8-bit Test  en la parte casi superior del medio.  Para manter las cosas simple, vamos a empezar a buscar el valor en memoria que guarda el numero de anillos que hemos recolectado. Nuestros pasos son los siguientes:    Carga el ROM y empieza una nueva partida.    Resetea la ventana de memoria: Haz click en  New 8-bit Test .    Regresa al juego y cambia el numero de anillos en la memoria. Por ejemplo, colecciona un anillo    En la ventana de memoria, ahora vamos a filtrar los valores que son 'mas grandes que los antiguos valores' (simbolo  > ). Seleccionamos esto y, entonces hacemos click en  Filter .    Cuando ya estes haciendo esto por una 3ra y 4ta vez, el numero de posibilidades o 'candidatos' va a ir disminuyendo. Vamos a seguir haciendo esto asta que lleguemos a un numero muy peque\u00f1o (el mas peque\u00f1o que sea posible), puede llegar a tomar entre 4-5 intentos. Ahora podemos hacer click en la ventana de resultados, y monitoriar los valores en memoria, hasta abajo en el visor de memoria. Continua en el juego y deberias de ver como los valores en la memoria cambian cada vez que coleccionas anillos. Si no es asi, o si algo no se ve bien, intenta otro valor. Con el primer Sonic the Hedgehog, el valor en memoria para el numero de anillos deberia de ser  0xfe20 .    Nota 1 : Utilizando estados de guardados (save states)(F5 para salvar un estado, F8 para cargar un estado, F6-F7 para cambiar que estados utilizar), puedes brincar entre estados de guardado permitiendo esto alterar la RAM, y utilizarlo para filtrar malos candidatos. Puedes buscar resultados que permanescan iguales (Es decir si es que sabes que un valor no tuvo que haber cambiado, utiliza  = ), o para valores que son diferentes (utiliza 'no igual', simbolo  != ).    Nota 2 : Afortunadamente no hay una garantia de un juego a otro para saber como los desarrolladores almacenaban la informacion (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, decimales con codigo binario, negativo/invertido. Por ejemplo utilizando 0xff/0xffff para representar 'fijo', o algo completamente aleatorio), pero eventualmente deberias de encontrarte con varios buenos valores. Nota si estas batallando en encontrar buenos valores, postea en el  Foro de Ayuda de RetroAchievements.org , o en el  Servidor de Discord de RetroAchievements . Hay bastante gente que estaria dispuesta en ayudarte con mucho gusto!!    Tip : Si te gusta experimentar con la memoria, intenta ingresar valores directamente en el visor de la RAM. Esto puede causar efectos devastadores en un juego, o podria hacer exactamente lo que deseas que pase, (o inclusive nada!) De todos modos podria ser util, ver si ingresas un valor y paso el resultado que esperas. Utilizalo con cuidado!    Cuando encuentres un valor del que te sientes feliz con el, puedes escriber una peque\u00f1a nota de lo que es haciendo click en  Save Note , esto lo va a guardar en la base de datos, y va a ser automaticamente cargado la siguiente vez que cargues el visor de memoria para ese juego, donde sea que te encuentres! Nota despues que haces click en 'Save Note', la nota va a ser automaticamente guardada en la base de datos y compartida, la cual todos los desarrolladores tendran acceso a ella. Todos van a descargar esa nota cuando carguen su ROM. Si intentas sobre-escribir una nota, te va a salir una ventana de confirmacion antes de guardarla.

Esta herramienta se puede encontrar en la pesta\u00f1a de \"RetroAchievements\" en cualquier emulador integrado con RA.\n\n\nTambien mira\n: \nTips en la Busqueda de Memoria\n.\n\n\nVentana del Inspector de Memoria\nlink\n\n\n\n\n1. Reset to (Resetear en)\nlink\n\n\nHaz click en uno de los botones para empezar una nueva pruba. Por lo general pruebas en 8-bit es lo mas apropiado. \n\n\n2. Filter Values (Filtrar Valores)\nlink\n\n\nUsualmente vas a filtrar ya sea en \n=\n (igual a) el ultimo valor conseguido o \n!=\n (diferente que) el ultimo valor conseguido. Si conoces el valor exacto que deseas buscar, puedes utilizar \nGiven Value\n(Valor entregado), o si estas convencido que el valor tuvo que haber incrementado, puedes intentar \n>\n (mayor que) o \n<\n (menor que).\n\n\n3. Filter! (Filtrar)\nlink\n\n\nCada vez que presiones este boton, estas filtrando los valores que no concuerdan en memoria entre el ultimo testeo y el de ahora.\n\n\n4. Ventana de Resultados\nlink\n\n\n\n\nDespues de haber filtrado los resultados miraras en la ventana exactamente que es lo que paso, cuantos valores has conseguido y cuantos estan fuera. Algunos puntos a tener en cuenta:\n\n\n\n\nLos resultados muestran cambios en los valores en tiempo real, asi puedes identificar mas facilmente las variables utiles.\n\n\nLos resultados en la busqueda estan resaltados dependiendo el criterio. Para valores que no cumplen el filtro de busqueda, van a estar resaltados en rojo. Puedes desactivar esto en la casilla de \nHighlights\n , si asi lo prefieres.\n\n\nTambien puedes manualmente excluir cualquier variable seleccionada de la busqueda. Utiliza la tecla Ctrl o Shift para seleccionar multiples a la vez.\n\n\nHistorial de Resultados\n: Te puedes mover hacia atras (\n<<\n) o hacia adelante (\n>>\n) por medio de las busquedas anteriores. Ten en cuenta que si empiezas una nueva busqueda (una \nNew 8-bit Test\n), tu historial va a ser borrado.\n\n\n\n\n5. Watching (Observando)\nlink\n\n\nCualquier valor que se encuentre aqui va a ser observado en el \nVisor de Memoria\n y se mostraran sus \nnotas de codigo\n a la derecha. La direccion tiene que ser \n0x\n (Un cero, y despues una letra x), seguido de digitos hexadecimales.\n\n\n6. Visor de Memoria\nlink\n\n\nCualquier variable que se este observando y las variables que tiene alrededor se muestran en esta ventana. Puedes ver mas informacion a continuacion, en la seccion de \nLeyendo informacion en el Visor de Memoria\n.\n\n\n7. Notas de Codigo\nlink\n\n\nUna vez que hubieras encontrado un valor en memoria del que quieras hacer una nota, serciorate que el valor este introducido en la caja que dice 'Watching' (Observando). Ahora puedes escribir una peque\u00f1a descripcion en la caja de texto, y hacer click en \nSave Note\n (Salvar Nota). Esto va a mandar el valor en memoria y su descripcion a la base de datos, para que puede ser compartida con todos los desarrolladores que trabajen con este juego.\n\n\nHaz click en la fleca hacia abajo para ver cuales valores en memoria han sido encontrados hasta ahora, junto con su descripcion, la cual te dice para que sirve esa variable.\n\n\nIntenta mantener tus descripciones limpias y simples, para que sean facil de entender. Para re-escribir una nota, seleccionala en la lista desglozable, actualiza la descripcion, y haz click en \nSave Note\n (Salvar Nota). Una ventana va a salir confirmando sobre-escribir la nota existente - checa si esta bien el cambio, y haz click en OK.\n\n\nSi deseas remover una nota, seleccionala en el menu desglozable, y haz click en \nRemove\n (Remover).\n\n\n8. Marcadores de Memoria\nlink\n\n\nCuando haces click en el boton \nOpen Memory Bookmarker\n (Abrir Marcadores de Memoria) vas a ver esta ventana:\n\n\n\n\nCon esto, puedes ver multiples variables designadas al mismo tiempo en vez de estar moviendote por todo el Inspector.\n\n\nLos marcadores pueden ser renombrados haciendo doble-click en su descripcion. Si haces doble click en la variable, te puedes mover directamente a ella en el Inspector de Memoria.\n\n\nValores agregados al marcador se van a mostrar en el inspector de memoria de color verde. Desde aqui tambien puedes Freezear (Congelar) cualquier marcador.\n\n\nEsto es util para cosas como vida o consumibles. Congelar variables puede ser manipulado directamente desde el inspector. Ten en mente que, el congelamiento ocurre \n1 frame despues del gameplay.\n Esto significa que incluso cuando este congelada, el valor no va a cambiar al menos que pase un frame para que pueda congelarse la variable. Esto siempre se va a mostrar como amarillo.\n\n\nLeyendo informacion en el Visor de Memoria\nlink\n\n\nNotaciones Decimales, Binarias y Hexadecimales\nlink\n\n\nPara trabajar bien con el Visor de Memoria, es importante entender minimo lo basico de los numeros binarios y hexadecimal. Aqui hay algunos recursos de informacion sobre este tema sin irnos a detalles muy extremos:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_binario\n\n\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_hexadecimal\n\n\n\n\nLos digitos utilizados en el \nsistema binario\n son \n0\n y \n1\n. Un \ndigito binario\n tambien es conocido como un \nbit\n.

Esto muestra cada byte de memoria como un valor de dos-caracteres hexadecimales por separado. Cada byte tiene su propia direccion.\n\n\nDieciseis bytes son mostrados por linea. La direccion de un byte se puede determinar a\u00f1adiendo la posicion de la fila (mostrada a la izquierda del vizor) a la posicion de la columna (mostrada arriba del visor). Usando la \nimagen de arriba\n como un ejemplo, el cursor esta en \n0x002a7\n (\n0x002a0\n + \n7\n).\n\n\nModo 16/32-bit\nlink\n\n\nAntes de que hables del modo de 16-bit mode y 32-bit, es importante saber sobre el endianness (extremidad):\n\n\n\n\nEndianness\nlink\n\n\nSe describe como Endianness el orden en el que una secuencia de bytes se encuentra almacenada en memoria de una computadora. Los dos tipos mas comunes son: \nBig-Endian\n (tambien conocido como BE) y \nLittle-Endian\n (tambien conocido como LE).\n\n\nEn el orden \nBig-Endian\n la \"big end\" (extremidad) de un numero (el valor mas significativo en secuencia) es almacenado primero (posicionado en la direccion mas peque\u00f1a). En la imagen de abajo puedes ver el numero \n0x12345678\n almacenado en la direccion \n0x100\n en el sistema big-endian. Ten en cuenta que el byte mas significativo \n0x12\n se encunetra en la direccion \n0x100\n:\n\n\n\n\nEn el orden \nLittle-Endian\n el \"little end\" (extremidad) de un numero (el valor menos significativo en secuencia) es almacenado primero (posicionado en la direccion mas grande). En la imagen de abajo puedes ver el numero \n0x12345678\n almacenado en la direccion \n0x100\n en orden little-endian. Ten en cuenta que el byte menos significativo \n0x78\n se encuentra en la direccion \n0x100\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValores que necesitan mas de 8-bits (en otras palabras: mas grandes que 255) necesitan estar almacenado en multiples bytes. Inclusive, los sistemas emulados que utilizamos almacenan valores de multiples-bytes en orden little-endian.\n\n\nEn la \nimagen del Visor de Memoria de arriba\n puedes ver que en la direccion \n0x0002c0\n tenemos el valor hexadecimal \nce\n y en \n0x0002c1\n el valor es \n39\n. Cuando cambias el visor a modo de 16-bit, los valores \nce\n y \n39\n se agrupan en \n0x0002c0\n y son mostrados como \n39ce\n. Esto pasa porque automaticamente agrupa cada dos bytes y los muestra como valos hexadecimales de 16-bit.\n\n\nNOTA\n: Mientras que los valores de 16-bits se alinean generalmente a direcciones pares, este no siempre es el caso. De hecho hay un valor de 16-bit que no se muestra en \n0x0002c1\n. Ya que el valor en \n0x0002c1\n es \n39\n y el valor en \n0x0002c2\n es \n29\n, el valor de 16-bit value en la direccion \n0x0002c1\nes \n0x2939\n.\n\n\nSimilarmente en, el modo de 32-bit, los cuatro bytes de \n0x0002c0\n a \n0x0002c3\n se muestran como un solo valor de 32-bit \n0x252939ce\n en la direccion \n0x0002c0\n, pero tambien hay valores de 32-bit en \n0x0002c1\n, \n0x0002c2\n, and \n0x0002c3\n.\n\n\nTrabajando con tama\u00f1os inferiores a 8-bit\nlink\n\n\nEn addicion al 8-bit, 16-bit y 32-bit los tama\u00f1os descritos arriba, existen tama\u00f1os adicionales que pueden ser utilizados al momentos que estemos creando logros (en el editor de Logros (Achievement Editor)).\n\n\nSingle bits\nlink\n\n\nEn el visor de memoria cuando un valor de 8-bit es seleccionado vas a ver algo como la imagen de abajo (en la imagen: un byte con valor \n6f\n es seleccionado; los bits estan resaltados con un circulo naranja):\n\n\n\n\nEs muy comun almacenar informacion importante en un solo bit. Ya que un bit solo puede tener dos posibles valores (\n1\n o \n0\n), algunas veces se utiliza para significarn \"si\" o \"no\", \"encendido\" o \"apagado\", \"tiene un item\" o \"no item\", etc. Algunos juegos, especialmente aquellos que tienen espacio muy limitado en memoria, utilizan bit como botones bastante.\n\n\nImportante:\n Puedes referirte a cada uno de esos bits indidualmente en el Editor de Logros (Achievement Editor).\n\n\nSignificados mas comunes de botones de bit en la memoria de un juego:\n\n\n\n\ntienes un item\n\n\nboton presionado (muy comun)\n\n\narea explorada\n\n\nsecuencia del juego activated\n\n\ncheat activado\n\n\nmodo demo activo\n\n\n\n\nEn el visor de memoria solo puedes ingresar valores hex, entonces es importante conocer la importancia entre valores con notacion hexadecimal y binaria. Puedes ver en la tabla de \"\nNotaciones Decimales, Binarias y Hexadecimales\n\" , pero lo usual es usar una calculadora (la calculadora default de MS Windows en modo programador puede hacer el trabajo)\n\n\nUpper4 y Lower4\nlink\n\n\nUpper4\n son los cuatro bits superiores de un byte (bit: 7, 6, 5, 4), mostrados como un solo caracter hexadecimal. \nLower4\n son los cuatro bits inferiores de un byte (bit: 3, 2, 1, 0), mostrados como un solo caracter hexadecimal.\n\n\nObservando el \ndiagrama de tama\u00f1o de memoria\n de abajo, un byte en la direccion \n0x00a274\n es seleccionado (valor \n0x23\n). El primer caracter, \n2\n es el valor Upper4. El segundo characterr \n3\n es el valor Lower4.\n\n\nOcasionalmente solo vas a estar interesado en trabajar con solo un digito hexadecimal. Utilizando el \ndiagrama de tama\u00f1o de memoria\n como un ejemplo, como una condicion de un logro donde \nUpper4 0x00a274 = 0x2\n seria verdadera.

Cuando pasa el contador de hits es aumentado por uno mientras que el contador de dulces aumento en dos. Esto, obviamente, arruina la l\u00f3gica que utilizamos arriba.\n\n\nEn manera que podamos evitar este problema tenemos que utilizar la t\u00e9cnica de \nutilizar \nSubSource\n para contar incrementos espec\u00edficos\n combinado con una \n \nAddHits\n flag\n.\n\n\nEchemos un vistazo a la l\u00f3gica del logro y as\u00ed poder ver la explicaci\u00f3n:\n\n\nVariables (Addresses)\n\n\n\n\n0x80dc\n: Contador de Dulces.\n\n\n0x809c\n: ID de Stage.\n\n\n\n\nAs\u00ed que ahora la estructura de logro seria de esta manera:\n\n\n\n\nCondiciones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunto con la condici\u00f3n 2, es un truco para ver si \n0xDULCES - Delta 0xDULCES = 2\n.

Como se explica en \nsu respectiva pagina\n, cuando la condici\u00f3n de \nAddHits\n es verdadera, el hit counter en la siguiente condici\u00f3n es incrementado.

Buscar pedazos grandes de memoria solo complica las cosas, pero har\u00eda un trabajo mas f\u00e1cil para un desarrollador experimentado. Si tu estas empezando y no estas consciente de t\u00e9rminos como \nendianess\n y \nbit ordering\n (o cuando los ojos est\u00e1n cansados), es mejor hacer observaciones usando la vista de 8-bit. Es simplemente mas f\u00e1cil!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesmarca la casilla \"Show Decimal Values\"\n en el Editor de Logros (Achievement Editor) para as\u00ed poder introducir los valores hex que encuentres en el Visor de Memoria (Memory Viewer). Es mejor que estar utilizando una calculadora de programador!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi encuentras una variable, tambi\u00e9n busca en los alrededores de la misma podr\u00edas encontrar muchas variables utiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuedes introducir valores en el Visor de Memoria para ver si afectan al juego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluso si algo esta visiblemente decrementando en el juego, como la vida, la memoria podr\u00eda tener diferencias. Podr\u00eda ser posible que este incluso incrementando, as\u00ed que como es algo de lo que no estas del todo seguro, es preferible que utilices los filtros \n!=\n y \n=\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi tu absolutamente no puedes reducir los resultados de un filtro, puedes intentar adivinar algunos valores o m\u00ednimo como esta actuando ese valor (\n>\n o \n<\n). Por ejemplo, cero vida es usualmente \n0\n, Stage 1 es usualmente el valor \n0\n, Stage 2 es usualmente el valor \n1\n dependiendo el tipo de juego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVista de 16/32 bit\n: Recuerda que cuando trabajas con variables de 16 o 32 bit las variables de la derecha son primero. Por Ejemplo: si en 8bit se mira de esta manera \nAB CD WX YZ\n, en 16 bit se convierte en \nCDAB YZWX\n. A esto se le llama \"\nordenado de bits big endian\n\". Sin preocupaciones puedes ignorar esta platica geek, solamente recordando que las cosas se almacenan \nal rev\u00e9s\n en la vista de 16 bit y superiores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBit fields\n: Utiliza single bits para cosas que solamente cambian en un bit. En el Inspector de Memoria (Memory Inspector), cuando una variable es seleccionada, vas a encontrar \nBits: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n arriba de las variables. Y abajo de esos n\u00fameros va a ver ya sea un \n0\n o un \n1\n, as\u00ed como \n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1\n en la imagen de abajo. Si \nbit5\n tiene un \n1\n arriba de el, entonces \nbit3=1\n para esa variable. El uso de Single bit es muy com\u00fan en un juego para items/eventos/desbloqueos/etc. Tal vez suene un poco confuso , pero es muy importante que lo entiendas. Algunos juegos con espacio en memoria muy limite usan los campos de bits (Bit fields) much\u00edsimo! Es una t\u00e9cnica importante de aprender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips en la Creaci\u00f3n de Logros\nlink\n\n\nTambi\u00e9n mira: \nConceptos No-Bievenidos\n y \nDise\u00f1o de Logros\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNunca\n Evita utilizar solo una condici\u00f3n lo mas que puedas\n. Cuando utilizas solo una condici\u00f3n el logro es muy probable que salga en el momento equivocado.  Este es el \nerror mas com\u00fan de un desarrollador\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi el juego tiene un \nmodo demo\n (El CPU juega despu\u00e9s que hubieras esperado un tiempo en la pantalla de titulo), percatate de buscar la variable para ello y agrega la condicion para que tus logros no salgan en modo demo. Tal vez necesites saber como se utiliza un \nPauseIf\n y \nResetIf\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf\n cheat codes\n: Si el juego tiene un cheat code para incrementar vidas, seleccionar stages, etc. Percatate de encontrar las variables para ello y agregar alguna especie de protecci\u00f3n a tus logros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi quieres crear un logro para \ncolecciona un \u00edtem \u00fanico y especifico\n en el juego, agrega algunas condiciones para asegurarte que el jugador consigui\u00f3 el \u00edtem donde se supone que se tiene que conseguir, \ncomo en este ejemplo de aqu\u00ed\n. De otra manera podr\u00eda saltar utilizando un password, cargando un archivo de guardado, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondiciones \u00d3\n: si necesitas condiciones \u00d3, vas a necesitar \nAlt groups\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvita el exceso de Logros\n. Si un juego tiene 100 levels, no hagas un logro por cada nivel. Haz cada 25 o parecido. Considera el tiempo en el que un jugador casual podr\u00eda desbloquear esos logros. Si generalmente puedes desbloquear todos los logros de un set de progreso en medio hora y siendo un jugador casual, eso es dise\u00f1o de puro relleno, y no es recomendable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe Creativo y Divertido\n: Se lo mas creativo posible con tus logros. \"Vence a X sin utilizar/hacer Y\", \"Vence a X en 5 segundos\", \"p\u00e1sate el juego con solo 3 corazones\". Ten en mente que incluso el jugador casual puede sacarse todos los logros si pone su mejor esfuerzo. No es divertido para un jugador casual si es demasiado dif\u00edcil!  (Mira:  \nTips para Sets Bonus\n mas abajo para retos de verdad!). Hay una pagina completa sobre \nDise\u00f1o de Logros\n hay puedes conseguir buenas ideas para pensar en como hacer buenos logros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlitchless, por favor!\n: No hagas logros donde requieras el uso de glitches. Glitches, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, corrompen y destabilizan la RAM y memoria del juego. Para agregar b\u00e1sicamente rompen todo el set de logros. Por eso es, sabio agregar protecci\u00f3n a esto para as\u00ed detener a los jugadores de utilizarlos y conseguir los logros f\u00e1cilmente.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvita utilizar solamente texto y gr\u00e1ficas\n: La mayor\u00eda de las veces, un logro que requiere que pase cierto evento especial puede estar atado a una event flag (usualmente un single bit or byte), o a un objeto recibido por el jugador. Es mucho mejor utilizar estos valores que utilizar el ID de texto que se muestra en la caja de texto, o, mucho peor, RAM de v\u00eddeo (memoria atada a los gr\u00e1ficos que se muestran en pantalla) ya que muchas veces son menos estables. Especialmente en versiones diferentes del juego, y son mas dif\u00edciles de trabajar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmamos el Arte\n:  Badges bonitos son badges que dan gusto conseguir! Tiene que representar visualmente el logro en si, o una pista de acuerdo a la ubicaci\u00f3n en el juego para evadir secretos.  Que est\u00e9n a la par con el estilo de arte del juego funciona muy bien.  Buscar en Google Im\u00e1genes \"Sprite Sheets\" es un tip muy \u00fatil para incluir arte del juego. Si eres un buen artista gr\u00e1fico, sera tu tiempo de brillar actualizando badges! Puedes encontrar mas informaci\u00f3n en la \nPagina de Creaci\u00f3n de Badges e Iconos\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips en tu estructura gramatical\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo S\u00edmbolos\n: No utilizas caracteres de acentos/especiales como la \n\u00e9\n en Pokemon, ya que actualmente rompen algunas cosas (como el feed). Cambien no son visibles en la b\u00fasqueda si no se introduce el car\u00e1cter especial. Lo mismo para c\u00f3digos universales de Emoji UTF-8. \nExcepci\u00f3n Permitida\n: \nScripts de Rich Presence\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuida tu Ingles\n: evita errores ortogr\u00e1ficos. Como RetroAchievements es una comunidad internacional, utilizar el Ingles para las Notas de C\u00f3digo es una buena practica, ya que otro desarrollador puede utilizar tus notas en un futuro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrucos\nlink\n\n\nEncontrando la variable para el Modo Demo\nlink\n\n\nUn truco usual para empezar a filtrar valores para encontrar el Modo Demo es dejar que empieze y asi empezar a filtrar con \n=\n \"Last Known Value\" y presionar \"Filter\" suficiente veces, deteni\u00e9ndote una vez que el demo hubiera terminado (ten cuidado de no filtrar despu\u00e9s que se hubiera terminado el demo).\n\n\nAhora empieza el juego de manera normal y cuando tengas control del personaje cambie el filtro a \n!=\n y filtra \nsolo una vez\n. Los valores que se filtraron son los que cambiaron desde el modo demo.\n\n\nAhora cambien el filtro de regreso a \n=\n y entonces inicia una secuencia de jugar-y-filtrar. Que significa juega un poco, mu\u00e9vete por el escenario, derrota algunos enemigos, y entonces filtra.\n\n\nPro tip\n: Es muy muy muy \u00fatil tener estados de guardado (savestates) en diferentes niveles del juego, ya que puedes hacer lo de jugar-y-filtrar en diferentes escenarios y hacer el filtrado mas efectivo.\n\n\nDespu\u00e9s de conseguir algunas variables como resultado, por lo general el valor de demo es igual a \n1\n (algunas veces tambi\u00e9n es \nff\n). Si encuentras una direcci\u00f3n potencial editala a \n0\n y checa si eres capaz de mover al personaje. Si s\u00ed, BINGO!, esa es la variable que estabas buscando.\n\n\nObservador de Variables (Address Watcher)\nlink\n\n\nAqu\u00ed un truco f\u00e1cil utilizando un logro de prueba para observar si una variable tiene cambios, que es algo que tu vas a querer saber com\u00fanmente.\n\n\n\n\nCondiciones Explicadas\n  \n\n\n\n\nValor 1 = Valor 0\n; Esto es para prevenir que el logros jamas sea verdadero, ya que el valor 0 nunca va a ser igual a 1.\n\n\nValor 1 = Valor 1\n; Para que funcione este truco el logro necesita hits para que se resetee. Cuando 1 = 1 hits ser\u00e1n agregados a la condici\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n\nResetIf Mem 0x10 != Delta 0x10\n; Esta es la variable que quieres observar. Cada vez que hay un cambio el logro se va a reiniciar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPor ultimo checa que las casillas de \nPause on Reset\n y \nActive\n est\u00e9n marcadas. Ahora vas a conseguir un pop-up y la emulaci\u00f3n se va a pausar cada vez que la variable cambie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-04-14 13:53] eldexterr:\n Document Finished :)\n\n\n[2019-04-12 11:50] eldexterr:\n Document isn\u00b4t finish",

Y abajo de esos n\u00fameros va a ver ya sea un  0  o un  1 , as\u00ed como  0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1  en la imagen de abajo. Si  bit5  tiene un  1  arriba de el, entonces  bit3=1  para esa variable. El uso de Single bit es muy com\u00fan en un juego para items/eventos/desbloqueos/etc. Tal vez suene un poco confuso , pero es muy importante que lo entiendas. Algunos juegos con espacio en memoria muy limite usan los campos de bits (Bit fields) much\u00edsimo! Es una t\u00e9cnica importante de aprender.",

            "text": "Tambi\u00e9n mira:  Conceptos No-Bievenidos  y  Dise\u00f1o de Logros .    Nunca  Evita utilizar solo una condici\u00f3n lo mas que puedas . Cuando utilizas solo una condici\u00f3n el logro es muy probable que salga en el momento equivocado.  Este es el  error mas com\u00fan de un desarrollador .    Si el juego tiene un  modo demo  (El CPU juega despu\u00e9s que hubieras esperado un tiempo en la pantalla de titulo), percatate de buscar la variable para ello y agrega la condicion para que tus logros no salgan en modo demo. Tal vez necesites saber como se utiliza un  PauseIf  y  ResetIf .    PauseIf  cheat codes : Si el juego tiene un cheat code para incrementar vidas, seleccionar stages, etc. Percatate de encontrar las variables para ello y agregar alguna especie de protecci\u00f3n a tus logros.    Si quieres crear un logro para  colecciona un \u00edtem \u00fanico y especifico  en el juego, agrega algunas condiciones para asegurarte que el jugador consigui\u00f3 el \u00edtem donde se supone que se tiene que conseguir,  como en este ejemplo de aqu\u00ed . De otra manera podr\u00eda saltar utilizando un password, cargando un archivo de guardado, etc.    Condiciones \u00d3 : si necesitas condiciones \u00d3, vas a necesitar  Alt groups .    Evita el exceso de Logros . Si un juego tiene 100 levels, no hagas un logro por cada nivel. Haz cada 25 o parecido. Considera el tiempo en el que un jugador casual podr\u00eda desbloquear esos logros. Si generalmente puedes desbloquear todos los logros de un set de progreso en medio hora y siendo un jugador casual, eso es dise\u00f1o de puro relleno, y no es recomendable.    Se Creativo y Divertido : Se lo mas creativo posible con tus logros. \"Vence a X sin utilizar/hacer Y\", \"Vence a X en 5 segundos\", \"p\u00e1sate el juego con solo 3 corazones\". Ten en mente que incluso el jugador casual puede sacarse todos los logros si pone su mejor esfuerzo. No es divertido para un jugador casual si es demasiado dif\u00edcil!  (Mira:   Tips para Sets Bonus  mas abajo para retos de verdad!). Hay una pagina completa sobre  Dise\u00f1o de Logros  hay puedes conseguir buenas ideas para pensar en como hacer buenos logros.    Glitchless, por favor! : No hagas logros donde requieras el uso de glitches. Glitches, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, corrompen y destabilizan la RAM y memoria del juego. Para agregar b\u00e1sicamente rompen todo el set de logros. Por eso es, sabio agregar protecci\u00f3n a esto para as\u00ed detener a los jugadores de utilizarlos y conseguir los logros f\u00e1cilmente.    Evita utilizar solamente texto y gr\u00e1ficas : La mayor\u00eda de las veces, un logro que requiere que pase cierto evento especial puede estar atado a una event flag (usualmente un single bit or byte), o a un objeto recibido por el jugador. Es mucho mejor utilizar estos valores que utilizar el ID de texto que se muestra en la caja de texto, o, mucho peor, RAM de v\u00eddeo (memoria atada a los gr\u00e1ficos que se muestran en pantalla) ya que muchas veces son menos estables. Especialmente en versiones diferentes del juego, y son mas dif\u00edciles de trabajar.    Amamos el Arte :  Badges bonitos son badges que dan gusto conseguir! Tiene que representar visualmente el logro en si, o una pista de acuerdo a la ubicaci\u00f3n en el juego para evadir secretos.  Que est\u00e9n a la par con el estilo de arte del juego funciona muy bien.  Buscar en Google Im\u00e1genes \"Sprite Sheets\" es un tip muy \u00fatil para incluir arte del juego. Si eres un buen artista gr\u00e1fico, sera tu tiempo de brillar actualizando badges! Puedes encontrar mas informaci\u00f3n en la  Pagina de Creaci\u00f3n de Badges e Iconos .",

Ahora empieza el juego de manera normal y cuando tengas control del personaje cambie el filtro a  !=  y filtra  solo una vez . Los valores que se filtraron son los que cambiaron desde el modo demo.  Ahora cambien el filtro de regreso a  =  y entonces inicia una secuencia de jugar-y-filtrar. Que significa juega un poco, mu\u00e9vete por el escenario, derrota algunos enemigos, y entonces filtra.  Pro tip : Es muy muy muy \u00fatil tener estados de guardado (savestates) en diferentes niveles del juego, ya que puedes hacer lo de jugar-y-filtrar en diferentes escenarios y hacer el filtrado mas efectivo.  Despu\u00e9s de conseguir algunas variables como resultado, por lo general el valor de demo es igual a  1  (algunas veces tambi\u00e9n es  ff ). Si encuentras una direcci\u00f3n potencial editala a  0  y checa si eres capaz de mover al personaje. Si s\u00ed, BINGO!, esa es la variable que estabas buscando.",

Lo que estas apunto de ver no son reglas, solamente sugerencias.\n\n\nNota\n: ten encenta el \nC\u00f3digo de Conducta del Desarrollador\n\n\nEscala de Dificultad:\nlink\n\n\n\n\nRegalado\n\n\nFacil\n\n\nMedio\n\n\nMed-dificil\n\n\nDificil\n\n\nMuy-Dificil\n\n\nSuper-Dificil\n\n\n\n\nMas detalles sobre estos \nal final\n.\n\n\nEn general tiene que a ver un balance de dificultad uniforme.

Se espera la suficiente dificultad para que puedes dominar un set y as\u00ed decir que eres un maestro del juego. Pero tampoco necesita pedir demasiado para el jugador.\n\n\nTampoco no tienes que pedirle al jugador que haga tareas interminables y repetitivas solo para que un logro sea dificil. Hacer la misma tarea una y otro y otra vez no es dificil, es tipicamente aburrido. Tambi\u00e9n deber\u00edas de evitar hacer logros estilo marat\u00f3n con una colina hasta el final (aquellos que requiere un proceso largo con poca o repetitiva dificultad y entonces aparece un pico de dificultad enorme al final. No lo hagas!).\n\n\nLos Sets tienen que ser masterizados por un jugador con habilidad, que puso la dedicaci\u00f3n y esfuerzo necesario.\n\n\nUn Set tiene que reflejar el contenido del juego.

La Calidad es un factor clave.\n\n\nLa cantidad de logros depende fuertemente en la diversi\u00f3n y retos que un juego puede otorgar.

Puedes incluso descubrir que tan \u00fatiles son las sub-armas. Muy divertido!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere Are No Bullets in the Energy Zone (10)\n - retos pacifistas, cuando fuerzan al jugador a tener mas agilidad y romper viejos h\u00e1bitos.

El jugador lo obtiene por accidente y salta en la pantalla. Algunas veces el jugador ni siquiera tiene idea de porque lo consigui\u00f3. Algunos logros regalados son buenos algunos son malos.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n Empezar el juego, seleccionar un personaje, coleccionar un \u00edtem facil de conseguir, vencer a tu primer enemigo.\n\n\n1 - Facil\nlink\n\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de jugadores lo pueden conseguir en su primer intento, Algunos en su segundo o tercero.

Algunos despu\u00e9s de varios intentos. Algunos necesitan practicar. Muy pocos van a batallar mucho con ellos.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n Obt\u00e9n todos los switches de colores en Super Mario World, colecciona todos los items en un stage de Castlevania, obt\u00e9n un bonus en un \u00e1rea escondida, obt\u00e9n lunas en SMW.

Algunos lo van a encontrar muy retador, y se rendir\u00e1n.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n Obt\u00e9n una de las emeraldas chaos en Sonic 2.

Muchos no son capases de completarlo despu\u00e9s de muchos intentos. Usualmente requiere practica significativa, altas habilidades, experiencia, b\u00fasqueda, o gu\u00edas para completarlo.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n Completa Contra en una sola vida. Escapa de Zebes (Super Metroid) en 2 minutos o menos. Vence a los jefes de Megaman sin recibir da\u00f1o. Muchos de completa niveles sin recibir da\u00f1o, depende del juego.\n\n\n6 - Super Dif\u00edcil\nlink\n\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los jugadores no son capases de completarlo despu\u00e9s de decenas de intentos. Algunos jugadores tal vez nunca sean capases de completarlo ya que puede requerir noci\u00f3n del mando y el tiempo mas all\u00e1 de lo normal. Los jugadores con mas habilidad inclusive lo consideran bastante dificil. Puede reiniciar esfuerzos de maratones.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n Completa un juego sin conseguir da\u00f1o especialmente si el jugador tiene una barra de vida, retos que restringen al jugador drasticamente y requieren precisi\u00f3n por frame perfecta.

            "text": "Esta es una gu\u00eda en como pensar en un buen dise\u00f1o de logros. No el lado t\u00e9cnico sino el conceptual.\n\n\nEste contenido es un resumen de lo que \noriginalmente escribi\u00f3 el usuario de RA cirellio en un tema del foro\n.\n\n\nLogros basados en Progresi\u00f3n\nlink\n\n\nHay 3 tipos de logros basados en progresi\u00f3n: progresi\u00f3n simple, progresi\u00f3n basada en historia, y logros de progresi\u00f3n/colecci\u00f3n.\n\n\nProgresion Simple\nlink\n\n\nLogros basados en progresi\u00f3n son usualmente los mas simples, especialmente si el juego que estas haciendo es nada mas que eso. O no tiene mucho que ver con una trama/historia o algo parecido. En este caso, veamos algunos BUENOS y MALOS ejemplos sobre esto:\n\n\n\n\nBueno: Completa el stage 1. \n\n\nMalo: Llega al stage 2. \n\n\n\n\nToma ligeramente mas trabajo programar un logro donde el jugador necesita completar un stage en vez de simple llegar al siguiente. Pero es aparte mas satisfactorio para el jugador, y se ve mucho mas profesional. Aparte tambi\u00e9n es \nmenos susceptible a problemas donde los jugadores cargan partidas de guardado o estados de guardado (savestates) para logros gratis\n. \n\n\n\n\nBueno: Completa el juego. \n\n\nMalo: Empieza el juego. \n\n\n\n\nEs cierto que los logros basados en progresi\u00f3n son usualmente logros regalados, pero generalmente todos estamos de acuerdo en que un logro sobre empezar el juego es demasiado f\u00e1cil, y no del todo memorable para el jugador. Es simplemente es una norma, sin embargo es muchas veces la parte mas memorable de un juego para el jugador, y completar un juego es definitivamente un logro en si. Es correcto hacer un logro que funcione de la siguiente manera \"Completa el ultimo mundo y completa el juego\".\n\n\n\n\nBueno: Completa los stages con tem\u00e1tica de nieve, Completa los primeros cinco stages, o Completa los primeros diez stages. \n\n\nMalo: Completa el Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (todos los logros por separado) \n\n\n\n\nUna de las peores cosas que puedes hacer es spammear logros. Juegos de Puzzle son notorios por tener ese tipo de problemas, porque los stages son cortos y por lo regular, hay cientos o hasta mas. Como resultado, el feed de la pagina principal termina con un mont\u00f3n de micro-actualizaciones, y sacan a los logros de otros usuarios r\u00e1pidamente del feed. La manera de corregir esto de la manera mas profesional posible es espaciar los logros un poco mas, en grupos de stages. Por ejemplo, si los stages 1-10 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica de fuego, y los stages 11-20 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica del espacio, puedes crear logros basados en esas tem\u00e1ticas. Se creativo. \n\n\nProgresion Basada en Historia:\nlink\n\n\nLos momentos mas memorables en la historia de los videojuegos usualmente no est\u00e1n relacionados a coleccionar un \u00edtem o a misiones secundarias, sino a escenas especificas relacionadas con la historia. \n\n\nEjemplos:\n\n\n\n\nPrimer encuentro con Pyramid Head en la serie de Silent Hill. \n\n\nEncontrando la verdad sobre Darth Revan en Knights of the Old Republic. \n\n\nEncontrando que es lo que va a pasar en el futuro en Chrono Trigger. \n\n\nLanzando la Vaca en Earthworm Jim. \n\n\nCasi cualquier muerte de alg\u00fan personaje. \n\n\n\n\nLa cosa es de ser extremadamente cuidados con los spoilers. Si encuentras alg\u00fan logro relacionado con historia y cuenta con un spoiler, contacta al desarrollador responsable. Y a los desarrolladores, por favor sean comprensivos cuando se trate de critica constructiva, el numero y el porcentaje de este tipo de logros varia de juego en juego--Esto realmente se vasa en que tan fuertemente el juego esta enfocado en su historia. \n\n\nProgresi\u00f3n/Colecci\u00f3n\nlink\n\n\nProgresi\u00f3n/Colecci\u00f3n es com\u00fanmente un h\u00edbrido. No solo estas coleccionando un \u00edtem, sino tambi\u00e9n sale una memorable (y mandataria) escena.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n\n\n\n\nObtener la Master Sword en A Link to the Past, que levanta la maldici\u00f3n en Lost Woods. \n\n\nEncontrar la espada en la playa en Link's Awakening, y sale la primer escena en el que el sabio b\u00faho habla contigo. \n\n\nEscoger tu Pokemon, el cual sucede en escena del principio, pero b\u00e1sicamente es 'un ritual' para la mayor\u00eda de jugadores.\n\n\n\n\nLogros en esta categor\u00eda h\u00edbrida tipicamente mas satisfactorios ya que hacen doble-trabajo. El jugador no esta solamente obteniendo un \u00edtem, sino tambi\u00e9n viendo una escena memorable y obteniendo un logro a la vez. Bastante dosis de endorfinas! \n\n\nProgresion Pros y Contras\nlink\n\n\nLogros basados en progresi\u00f3n son garantizados que le van a salir al jugador en un play-through normal. Entonces para que tenerlos en primer lugar? \n\n\nPros\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUn jugador merece puntos por jugar un jugar! A si lo es! Recuerda, bastantes usuarios estan jugando estos juegos por primera vez, y la mayor\u00eda de los juegos son algo dif\u00edciles de pasar. Porque no deber\u00edamos de recompensarlos por un buen y cl\u00e1sico play-through? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogros de progresi\u00f3n constantes a largo plazo motivan a los jugadores a completar el juego. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgunos jugadores en este sitio web son mas casuales y no intentan hacer muchos mas que pasar juegos. No todos sienten la necesidad de Masterizar cada juego en Hardcore mode. Muchos son perfectamente felices agarrando uno que otro logro aparte durante su play-through normal, y no hay nada malo con eso. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgunas escenas son memorables, y merecen sus propio logros! Gente que creci\u00f3 con estos juegos mueren por ver esas escenas en la lista de logros, y tal vez les llegue un poco al coraz\u00f3n cuando vean que ya consiguieron ese logro. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Logros basados en progresi\u00f3n ayudan a otros usuarios a medir que tan lejos esta un jugador en el juego, un poco como  Rich Presence. Podemos decirle algo al jugador como, \"Buena suerte!\" porque sabemos que la siguiente secci\u00f3n sera bastante complicada. Motiva a la comunidad a interactuar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl orden importa! Logros de Progresion nos pueden decir sobre un play-through simplemente con el orden en el que salieron. Si sacaste un logro por ese jefe opcional y te ahorraste un mill\u00f3n de dolares DESPU\u00c9S de a ver hecho todas las  sidequests, ese es mucho meno impresionante si conseguiste hacerlo antes de la mitad del juego. En otras palabras, Logros de Progresion nos dan la oportunidad de mostrar un poco como jugamos! Podemos mostrarle al mundo que vencimos al ultimo jefe antes de llegar al nivel 10, o que pudimos vence el modo experto en nuestra primera pasada sin a ver intentado anteriormente F\u00e1cil o Normal. \nIncluso puede revelar si utilizamos glitches o trucos para saltarnos cierta parte del juego\n. As\u00ed que, como puedes ver, Logros de Progresion tienen una gran SINERGIA con otros tipos de logros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEste tipo de logros son los mas f\u00e1ciles de programar y est\u00e1n generalmente libre de errores. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContras\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemasiados logros de progresi\u00f3n pueden sobre-saturar un juego con logros 'regalados', y eso es algo Muy Malo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi tu juego tiene nada mas que este tipo de logros, es simplemente otro play-through aburrido para los jugadores. Llega al stage 2, Llega al stage 3, Llega al stage 4, Completa el Juego. Esta es una buena 'base' para agregar logros de otras categor\u00edas, pero \nno dejes tu lista en solamente logros de Progresion\n. De otra manera simplemente estas regalando puntos por algo que los jugadores han hecho un mill\u00f3n de veces anteriormente. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogros de Sidequests/Opcionales\nlink\n\n\nLos juegos de anta\u00f1o, por lo general, ofrecen de muy poco a nada por vencer un modo extra, mas all\u00e1 de simplemente hacerlo en un d\u00eda lluvioso despu\u00e9s de pasar el juego. Los juegos viejos no contaban con una conexi\u00f3n a Internet. Y no contaban con aspectos sociales mas all\u00e1 del modo de 2-jugadores, y tal vez decirle a tus amigos que pasaste algo. Pero ahora, con RetroAchievements.org, podemos mostrar nuestros logros de anta\u00f1o (incluso si implica volver a hacer lo que hicimos hace a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s). Estos Trofeos son medallas de honor. Puedes observar con ver los logros de otro compa\u00f1ero y empezar a entender que tan lejos a llegado, que tanta habilidad tiene. Junto con eso tambi\u00e9n viene el respeto hacia otros compa\u00f1eros. Socializamos, felicitamos a cualquiera que hubiera hecho un buen trabajo. Sentimos como si perteneci\u00e9ramos, y estuvi\u00e9ramos en buena compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\n\nMisiones Secundarias\nlink\n\n\nA menudo hay cosas que el jugador puede hacer, pero no son necesarias de completar. En otras palabras, un reto hecho por los desarrolladores. Usualmente son divertidas, o algunas veces no tanto, pero merecen un precio porque requieren de trabajo duro y persistencia para lograrlos. Tienes que caminar por una cuerda floja entre si los jugadores dedicados har\u00e1n algo al respecto, vs. si la meta es algo est\u00fapido. La gente simplemente le va a dar la vuelta, as\u00ed que ten eso en mente.\n\n\nAlgunas veces, este tipo de logros son incluso Easter Eggs o cosas que el jugador en toda su vida jam\u00e1s supo que exist\u00edan! Muchos jugadores adoran este tipo de logros. Yo pienso porque aprenden algo nuevo de un juego con el que crecieron, o pensaban que eran los \u00fanicos que saben sobre ello y se emocionan al verlo como un logro aqu\u00ed. \nEs realmente importante para nosotros los desarrolladores REALMENTE conocer el juego por dentro y por fuera antes de crear un set de logros.\n\n\nEjemplos de Misiones Secundarias:\n\n\n\n\nEntregar colas al Colector de Colar en Final Fantasy IV. \n\n\nEncontrar el due\u00f1o del \u00cdtem Insignificante en Earthbound. \n\n\nEntregar el Jerky a el Rey en el Castillo de Guardia. \n\n\nLa misi\u00f3n de Anju en Majora's Mask. \n\n\nSaber mas del pasado de Wrex en Mass Effect. \n\n\nLas misiones de escolta de Diplomacia/VIP en Flashback: The Quest for Identity. \n\n\nDescubrir un cuarto secreto. \n\n\n\n\nLas misiones secundarias son mas com\u00fanmente encontradas en RPGs, pero especialmente en estos d\u00edas, las sidequests se encuentra pr\u00e1cticamente en cualquier genero. Manten los ojos bien abiertos - Incluso el plataformero que menos piensas podr\u00eda tener una o dos sidequests. La serie de Kirby, en algunos casos, cuenta con \u00e1reas y cuartos escondidos. Algunas veces, las sidequests terminan otorgando un \u00edtem, que cae en un hibrido de: Misiones Secundarias/Colleccionables.\n\n\nLogros Opcionales\nlink\n\n\nEjemplos de Logros Opcionales:\n\n\n\n\nJefes opcionales. \n\n\nCompletar un calabozo de reto (que es un h\u00edbrido de una Sidequest). \n\n\nCompletar el Modo Experto (que es un h\u00edbrido de Progresion). \n\n\nCompletar un nivel de reto secreto. \n\n\nConseguir un \u00edtem bastante raro de un monstruo. \n\n\nCompletar el juego con un personaje opcional. \n\n\nObtener alguna puntuaci\u00f3n. \n\n\nCompletar caracter\u00edsticas que solo se desbloquean en la segunda pasada. \n\n\nModos de juego que solo se desbloquean en m\u00faltiples pasadas. \n\n\nFinales del juego opcionales. \n\n\nC\u00f3digos que puedes introducir en la pantalla de t\u00edtulo para hacer el juego mas dificil. \n\n\n\n\nEstos son los desarrolladores del juego esperando a que te guste su juego lo suficiente para que vuelvas a el aun mas, incluso despu\u00e9s que hubieran rodado los cr\u00e9ditos. Ellos intentan recompensar al jugador por completar su juego, y crear un poco mas de re-jugabilidad. Si los desarrolladores del juego se dieron la molestia de hacer cosas como estas una parte integral del juego, nosotros como desarrolladores de logros deber\u00edamos de reconocer estos retos y crear los logros adecuados tan siquiera para algunos de ellos.\n\n\nChrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, y Star Ocean: The Second Story son famosos por hacer esto. Las entregas para el Game Boy Advance de Castlevania tambi\u00e9n hacen esto. En efecto, muchos juegos lo hacen. Si no estas completamente seguro de que tu juego cuente con modos extras o retos, procura hacer un poco de research y checar algunos FAQs. O tambi\u00e9n puedes preg\u00fantale a la comunidad de aqu\u00ed, varios de nosotros somo expertos en varios juegos de aqu\u00ed. \n\n\nSidequests/Opcionales Pros y Contras\nlink\n\n\nLos logros de Sidequests/Opcionales son fant\u00e1sticos suplementos para los logros de Progresion. \n\n\nPros\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsta es el pan-y-mantequilla de los logros. Chances hay de que, una buena cantidad de tus logros vengan de esta categor\u00eda. Todos los juegos tienen cosas opcionales que hacer. Colecciona todas las monedas en un nivel! Consigue 9 vidas! Crear logros de este tipo es f\u00e1cil, y recompensa al jugador por su dedicaci\u00f3n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos desarrolladores de juegos aman a los jugadores que aprecian las cosas. Les gusta cuando los jugadores se toman la molestia de adentrarse profundamente en sus juegos, apreciando su trabajo duro, de otra manera no mirar\u00edamos  cosas 'divertidas' escondidas en juegos como Easter Eggs, escenas bonus, etc. Si los desarrolladores de juegos recompensan al jugador por hacerlo, porque nosotros no? Nosotros desarrolladores tambi\u00e9n tenemos que reconocer cuando el jugador a recorrido una milla extra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos jugadores aman decirle a sus amigos cuando encuentran algo inusual y fuera de lo com\u00fan en un juego. Con este sitio, ellos pueden mostrarle a sus amigos que si mataron a la 'rana amarilla' que rara vez se ve en el pantano, o encontraron el transportador a la 'dimensi\u00f3n desconocida'. Si incluimos estas curiosidades en nuestras listas de logros, le estamos demostrando a los jugadores que 'estamos informados', que crea confianza en que podemos guiarlos completamente por el juego. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogros de Sidequests/Opcionales le dan a los jugadores algo por lo que esforzarse despu\u00e9s de haber pasado el juego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstos tipos de logros pueden ser com\u00fanmente conseguidos en cualquier momento. Los jugadores sienten un llegue mas fuerte de endorfinas cuando un logro sale cuando ellos no esperaban conseguirlo, pero se le fue premiado. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstos tipos de logros son por lo general f\u00e1ciles de programar, despu\u00e9s de los logros tipo progresi\u00f3n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContras\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA algunos jugadores no les interesa explorar mas all\u00e1 de lo que ofrece el t\u00edpico play-through, as\u00ed que un set con un gran porcentaje de este tipo de logros pueden sentir al jugador como si no se le hubiera premiado lo suficiente. (Por supuesto, este tipo de jugador es un poco raro en un sitio web centrado en logros.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlguna gente podr\u00eda sentir que un reto en especifico es muy complicado, incluso si es algo que originalmente los desarrolladores incluyeron para que los jugadores lo consigan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuando creas un logro de Sidequests/Opcional digamos, por ejemplo, escapa de 999 batallas (u otro logro de llegar a un  nivel-m\u00e1ximo), te arriesgas a que la gente del sitio tal vez sientan que el logro no ofrece realmente un reto sino que  simplemente es un 'grind-fest'. Logros de este tipo son muy probables que sean dados de baja al menos que tenga un segundo prop\u00f3sito, como en Final Fantasy V donde el hecho escapar de batallas le da energ\u00eda a un arma que se llama 'Chicken Knife'. Esto tiene una SINERGIA con el juego, en comparaci\u00f3n a crear un logro en el que se basa solamente en llegar al x nivel mas alto sin ning\u00fan otro prop\u00f3sito.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogros Basados en Coleccionables\nlink\n\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los logros basados en coleccionables son opcionales, al menos que los items sean MacGuffins, que en ese caso ya cae en Progresi\u00f3n/Colecci\u00f3n.\n\n\nEjemplos:\n\n\n\n\nEncontrar los sombreros de Mickey escondidos para conseguir 1-ups en Aladdin de Genesis. \n\n\nEncontrar items excepcionalmente escondidos. \n\n\nBestiarios. \n\n\nDesbloquear un personaje opcional. \n\n\nLlegar al M\u00e1ximo de Dinero/Bajas/Habilidades. \n\n\nEncontrar todas las diferentes maneras de morir en juegos como Prince of Persia o Shadowgate. \n\n\nAbrir todos los cofres en un juego/encontrar cada powerup. \n\n\nTodos los items/Coleccionar 99 o 255 (etc.) un \u00edtem en particular. \n\n\nAtrapar todos los Pokemon (cualquier colecci\u00f3n de monstruos, en general.) \n\n\n\n\nSi el juego almacena cierta stat/habilidad, los desarrolladores pr\u00e1cticamente te est\u00e1n motivando a que lo maximices. Ahora, podr\u00edas ser ese tipo de jugador, o tal vez no. Eso tienes que pregunt\u00e1rtelo a ti mismo, como un desarrollador, como quieras o no, otros jugadores si podr\u00edan ser capaz de conseguir esas 9999 bajas de murci\u00e9lagos vampiro por ejemplo, incluso si tu no lo hicieras. Las ventajas de esto es que la gente que no lo haria normalmente ahora tiene algo por lo que volver cuando tengan ganas de volver a jugar el juego. La desventaja es que hay otros jugadores que no llegarian tan lejos como para hacerlo, pero tambi\u00e9n sienten que tienen que MASTERIZAR cada juego r\u00e1pidamente (algo un poco raro), al final se van a quejar. Y si consigues bastantes quejas, tal vez quieras dar de baja ese logro de haz 9999 o a algo un poco mas razonable, como 500. Si nadie se divierte haciendo alg\u00fan logro, ese simplemente no es el esp\u00edritu de jugar juegos y de hacer logros. \n\n\nTienes que utilizar tu criterio y pensar que es lo que el jugador disfrutar\u00eda mas. Como una regla de oro, es mejor tener algunos logros sobre Sidequests/Opcionales que ni siquiera ninguno. Pero con un poco de empe\u00f1o extra, estos logros pueden hacer tu lista mucho mas memorable. \n\n\nSiguiente, a llegado el momento de que nos subamos nuestras mangas como desarrolladores y nos pongamos MUY creativos, hemos llegado cuando el desarrollador reta al jugador a retos que van mucho mas all\u00e1 de las reglas del juego.\n\n\nLogros por Diversi\u00f3n\nlink\n\n\nEste tipo de logros usualmente otorgan solamente algunos puntos, pero siguen siendo divertidos\n\n\nEjemplos de Por Diversi\u00f3n:\n\n\n\n\nDeja que el reloj llega a las 99:59 en Valkyrie Profile. \n\n\nFondos Interactivos, as\u00ed como el cad\u00e1ver colgando en el stage 1 de Castlevania: Bloodlines. \n\n\nCocinar el hamster en el micro-ondas en Maniac Mansion. \n\n\nVer el apocal\u00edpsis en Majora's Mask. \n\n\nEncontrar a John Romero en Doom 2. \n\n\n\n\nAlgunas veces, los desarrolladores dejan divertidos easter eggs. Ellos se van la milla extra para entrener al jugador con \u00a8que pasar\u00eda si...\u00a8. De nuevo, es nuestro trabajo identificar este tipo de casos y as\u00ed darles soporte como desarrolladores.\n\n\nRetos\nlink\n\n\nUna cosa que tienes que recordar sobre jugadores retro - y los juegos que juegan - es que la mayor\u00eda de las veces nosotros hemos jugado estos juegos un mill\u00f3n de veces anteriormente. Esta es la misma vieja canci\u00f3n y baile para la mayor\u00eda de nosotros, e inclusive a veces necesitamos algo de motivaci\u00f3n para hacerlo de nuevo. Algunos de nosotros hemos terminado Contra sin perder una sola vida. Bueno, a llegado la hora que lo demostremos! \n\n\nA lo que me refiero es que, pi\u00e9nsalo: Antes de este sitio web, la \u00fanica manera de demostrarle a alguien que te pasaste Contra perfectamente era invitar a un amigo para que lo viera, o moverle a un software de grabaci\u00f3n de v\u00eddeo y subir un a YouTube. Pero incluso hay, muchos de esos v\u00eddeos est\u00e1n modificados para que se vean que fue un playthrough perfectos. En cambio, este sitio, cuenta con Hardcore mode, que te ayuda a indicar que nadie esta haciendo trampa. \n\n\nTal vez ya cuentes con logros de progresi\u00f3n y logros sobre Sidequests/Opcionales, pero si tu quieres crear una lista de logros que sea realmente grandiosa, necesitas al menos algunos logros sobre Retos. Intenta pensar atr\u00e1s a cerca de todos los juegos que haz jugado en este sitio web. Cuales son algunos de los logros mas memorables? Te puedo garantizar que son Logros sobre Retos. Hay excepciones en la regla, claro, pero el jugador tipico no va a realmente recordar un logro sobre, 'Completa el Stage 2-6', o 'Llega al Nivel 30'. Es mas probable que recuerden logros que convirtieron a su playthrough en una experiencia \u00fanica, as\u00ed como...\n\n\n\n\ncompleta todo el juego sin nunca haber recogido un power-up o moneda\n\n\nderrota a un jefe sin nunca haber recibido un golpe\n\n\ncompleta un stage sin perder una sola vida\n\n\n\n\nEsto es lo que hace a este sitio tan especial, y lo que hace a los logros algo mucho mas de simplemente completar el juego. \n\n\nIncluso los jugadores que odian la simple idea de los Logros podr\u00edan decir, \"Bueno, excepto por ESTE. Este si estaba bien.\" y te puedo garantizar que el ejemplo del que ESE ejemplo del que estaban hablando fue un logro sobre un reto, algo que reta al jugador mas all\u00e1 del juego en si. \n\n\nUn buen desarrollador de logros va a mantener sus ojos bien abiertos, y sus sentidos al m\u00e1ximo cuando se trate de desarrollar un juego, buscando buenos e inusuales retos. Tal vez notes algo en el juego que seria una haza\u00f1a bastante complicada y que vale la pena.\n\n\nRetos de Speedruns\nlink\n\n\nLos Timers introducen una presi\u00f3n a los jugadores en sus juegos favoritos que tal vez jamas hubieran sentido. Muy pocas cosas hacen que el coraz\u00f3n se acelere tanto que un reloj haciendo tik-tok. A\u00f1ade un timer, y un juego que era anteriormente tan f\u00e1cil que se poda completar con los ojos cerrados se va a convertir transformar de repente en la prueba jugabilista definitiva de sus vidas. \n\n\nEjemplos de Retos de Speedruns:\n\n\n\n\nCompleta un juego en menos de una hora. \n\n\nCompleta un nivel en especifico en menos de tres minutos. \n\n\nCompleta un nivel antes de que el contador llega a ciertos segundos. \n\n\nDerrota a 30 murci\u00e9lagos vampiro durante la secuencia de escape. \n\n\nColecciona 99 monedas bonus antes que termine la secuencia bonus. \n\n\nLlega al punto A a el punto B antes de que el d\u00eda cambie a noche. \n\n\nTabla de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa el juego en el tiempo mas r\u00e1pido posible. \n\n\nTabla de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa un Stage en el tiempo mas r\u00e1pido posible. \n\n\n\n\nUn desarrollador tal vez quiera ir a YouTube o Twitch y ver que tan r\u00e1pido la gente esta terminando un juego (Y por favor ignora v\u00eddeos que utilicen TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Algunos pro speed-runners son muy r\u00e1pidos que el jugador t\u00edpico no tendr\u00eda la posibilidad de lograrlo en ese tiempo establecido, tienes que encontrar una manera que sea un buen balance. Y si no puedes encontrar un buen tiempo el cual retar a los jugadores, para eso est\u00e1n las tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n - Convi\u00e9rtelo en una competici\u00f3n! De hecho, algunos de tus celebridades favoritas del mundo del speedrun podr\u00edan venir a este sitio y meter uno que otro tiempo. \n\n\nTu sabes cuando un logro te esta metiendo presi\u00f3n cuando te empiezan a sudar las manos y te encuentras nervioso mientras observas y observas el reloj. Como dije anteriormente, nada grita mas fuerte, \"Despierta!\" que un timer, especialmente cuando los desarrolladores empiezan a\u00f1adir este tipo de logros con OTROS tipos de logros (e incluso tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n) durante una secci\u00f3n contrarreloj del juego. Los Retos de Tiempo tienen una sinergia muy grande con otros tipos de logros. \n\n\nRetos de Limitaciones\nlink\n\n\nEjemplos de Retos con Limitaciones:\n\n\n\n\nCompleta un combate o inclusive el juego completo solamente con los personajes de cierta clase en especifico. (Un famoso ejemplo es completar Final Fantasy con un grupo de Magos Blancos.) \n\n\nVence al jefe final sin equipo puesto. \n\n\nCompleta un stage sin brincar. \n\n\nCompleta un puzzle con solo dos movimientos. \n\n\nOne-hit KOs. \n\n\nLow level games (LLGs). \n\n\nLogros sin que te peguen. \n\n\nNunca presiones cierto bot\u00f3n(es) durante un reto. \n\n\nNunca pierdas invisibilidad en un nivel completo de Mario 3, encontrando los suficientes Starmen. \n\n\nDerrota a cierto enemigo sin utilizar cierto movimiento. \n\n\nLlega con Ganon en The Legend of Zelda, sin espada. \n\n\nDerreto a cierto enemigo utilizando SOLAMENTE cierto movimiento. \n\n\nCompleta un laberinto mientras estas ebrio/confundido. \n\n\nCompleta el juego mientra te encuentras en un estado alterado. \n\n\n\n\nSitios web basados en juegos en especifico son un recurso fant\u00e1stico para encontrar estos tipos de logros ellos tienen una muy buena idea de que es posible y que es imposible, e inclusive han asta escrito FAQs discutiendo retos alternos y maneras diferente de jugar el juego. \n\n\nAlgunas veces, pasara de que no hay en si una comunidad. No FAQs. No tablas de mensajes. E inclusive tal vez no all\u00e1 v\u00eddeos \u00fatiles. En esos casos, tu necesitas ser una persona con la idea de crear nuevos e interesantes retos para el jugador. Ten en cuenta que ese tipo de logros toman mucha practica, tiempo, y experiencia para ser creados. \n\n\nLa clave de esto es que SEAS CREATIVO! Y recuerda mantenerlo DIVERTIDO! \n\n\nRetos de Puntuaci\u00f3n\nlink\n\n\nEjemplos de Retos de Puntuaci\u00f3n:\n\n\n\n\nCompleta un juego o un nivel con la puntuaci\u00f3n mas baja posible. \n\n\nCompleta un minijuego con la puntuaci\u00f3n perfecta (no simplemente le ganas al CPU en las tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n). \n\n\nTablas de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa el juego con la puntuaci\u00f3n mas alta/mas dinero/mejor cantidad de bajas/etc. posible. \n\n\nTablas de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa un nivel en especifico con la puntuaci\u00f3n mas alta/mas dinero/mejor cantidad de bajas/etc. posible.\n\n\n\n\nRetos Pros y Contras\nlink\n\n\nLogros sobre retos son tu oportunidad para mostrarle a los jugadores como jugar sus juegos favoritos de una manera diferente, \u00fanica, y inclusive en maneras alucinantes. A pesar de que este tipo de logros le dan un respiro de vida a un set aburrido, tu generalmente solo quieres que una peque\u00f1a parte de este tipo de logros est\u00e9n en tu lista final. \n\n\nPros\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA los jugadores Hardcore les encantan esforzarse en este tipo de logros. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi algunos jugadores son bastante hardcore, puedes encontrar un buen punto medio implementando tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n, que satisface a los dos a la vez al cazador de logros casual y los jugadores hardcore. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsta es tu oportunidad para ponerte bastante creativo y venir con nuevos retos que los jugadores jamas se esperar\u00edan. Esta puede ser una grata sorpresa y podr\u00eda hacer tus listas verdaderamente memorables. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContras\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstos tipos de logros requiere una cantidad justa de creatividad, aunque hay muchas maneras de encontrar maneras inusuales de completar juegos como por ejemplo viendo cosas como speed runs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodr\u00eda requerir bastante b\u00fasqueda previa. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstos logros son notoriamente complicados de codificar. Estos requieren que hagas bastantes notas de c\u00f3digo, hacer bastante observaciones en las mec\u00e1nicas del juego, e inclusive a veces requieren testear bugs incluso antes que funcionen correctamente. De hecho, tal vez no te encuentres listo para hacer este tipo de logros asta que cuentes con bastantes bastantes sets de logros hechos. Afortunadamente, Logros sobre Retos siempre pueden ser agregados despu\u00e9s. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecursos Externos\nlink\n\n\n\n\nGu\u00eda en las Mejores practicas en la creaci\u00f3n de logros\n escrito por  Jeff Sullivan, Desarrollador en Administraci\u00f3n de Cuentas de XNA Developer Connection (XDC) respecto a los logros de Xbox 360.\n\n\nHazlos trabajar por eso\n una gu\u00eda de dise\u00f1o de logros escrita por Darran Jamieson el 1 de Enero del 2013.\n\n\nLa Maquina de Logros: Entendiendo los Logros de Xbox 360 en practicas videojugables\n - de Mikael Jakobsson\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-05-12 13:11] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-11 18:54] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-10 17:08] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-10 11:58] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-08 17:30] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-04-25 19:25] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-04-24 16:49] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-04-23 17:38] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-04-22 17:12] eldexterr:\n Updated Achievement Design es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-04-17 17:45] eldexterr:\n Updated but still not finished",

O no tiene mucho que ver con una trama/historia o algo parecido. En este caso, veamos algunos BUENOS y MALOS ejemplos sobre esto:   Bueno: Completa el stage 1.   Malo: Llega al stage 2.    Toma ligeramente mas trabajo programar un logro donde el jugador necesita completar un stage en vez de simple llegar al siguiente. Pero es aparte mas satisfactorio para el jugador, y se ve mucho mas profesional. Aparte tambi\u00e9n es  menos susceptible a problemas donde los jugadores cargan partidas de guardado o estados de guardado (savestates) para logros gratis .    Bueno: Completa el juego.   Malo: Empieza el juego.    Es cierto que los logros basados en progresi\u00f3n son usualmente logros regalados, pero generalmente todos estamos de acuerdo en que un logro sobre empezar el juego es demasiado f\u00e1cil, y no del todo memorable para el jugador. Es simplemente es una norma, sin embargo es muchas veces la parte mas memorable de un juego para el jugador, y completar un juego es definitivamente un logro en si. Es correcto hacer un logro que funcione de la siguiente manera \"Completa el ultimo mundo y completa el juego\".   Bueno: Completa los stages con tem\u00e1tica de nieve, Completa los primeros cinco stages, o Completa los primeros diez stages.   Malo: Completa el Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (todos los logros por separado)    Una de las peores cosas que puedes hacer es spammear logros. Juegos de Puzzle son notorios por tener ese tipo de problemas, porque los stages son cortos y por lo regular, hay cientos o hasta mas. Como resultado, el feed de la pagina principal termina con un mont\u00f3n de micro-actualizaciones, y sacan a los logros de otros usuarios r\u00e1pidamente del feed. La manera de corregir esto de la manera mas profesional posible es espaciar los logros un poco mas, en grupos de stages. Por ejemplo, si los stages 1-10 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica de fuego, y los stages 11-20 todos tienen tem\u00e1tica del espacio, puedes crear logros basados en esas tem\u00e1ticas. Se creativo.",

Intenta pensar atr\u00e1s a cerca de todos los juegos que haz jugado en este sitio web. Cuales son algunos de los logros mas memorables? Te puedo garantizar que son Logros sobre Retos. Hay excepciones en la regla, claro, pero el jugador tipico no va a realmente recordar un logro sobre, 'Completa el Stage 2-6', o 'Llega al Nivel 30'. Es mas probable que recuerden logros que convirtieron a su playthrough en una experiencia \u00fanica, as\u00ed como...   completa todo el juego sin nunca haber recogido un power-up o moneda  derrota a un jefe sin nunca haber recibido un golpe  completa un stage sin perder una sola vida   Esto es lo que hace a este sitio tan especial, y lo que hace a los logros algo mucho mas de simplemente completar el juego.   Incluso los jugadores que odian la simple idea de los Logros podr\u00edan decir, \"Bueno, excepto por ESTE. Este si estaba bien.\" y te puedo garantizar que el ejemplo del que ESE ejemplo del que estaban hablando fue un logro sobre un reto, algo que reta al jugador mas all\u00e1 del juego en si.   Un buen desarrollador de logros va a mantener sus ojos bien abiertos, y sus sentidos al m\u00e1ximo cuando se trate de desarrollar un juego, buscando buenos e inusuales retos. Tal vez notes algo en el juego que seria una haza\u00f1a bastante complicada y que vale la pena.",

Muy pocas cosas hacen que el coraz\u00f3n se acelere tanto que un reloj haciendo tik-tok. A\u00f1ade un timer, y un juego que era anteriormente tan f\u00e1cil que se poda completar con los ojos cerrados se va a convertir transformar de repente en la prueba jugabilista definitiva de sus vidas.   Ejemplos de Retos de Speedruns:   Completa un juego en menos de una hora.   Completa un nivel en especifico en menos de tres minutos.   Completa un nivel antes de que el contador llega a ciertos segundos.   Derrota a 30 murci\u00e9lagos vampiro durante la secuencia de escape.   Colecciona 99 monedas bonus antes que termine la secuencia bonus.   Llega al punto A a el punto B antes de que el d\u00eda cambie a noche.   Tabla de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa el juego en el tiempo mas r\u00e1pido posible.   Tabla de Clasificaci\u00f3n - Completa un Stage en el tiempo mas r\u00e1pido posible.    Un desarrollador tal vez quiera ir a YouTube o Twitch y ver que tan r\u00e1pido la gente esta terminando un juego (Y por favor ignora v\u00eddeos que utilicen TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Algunos pro speed-runners son muy r\u00e1pidos que el jugador t\u00edpico no tendr\u00eda la posibilidad de lograrlo en ese tiempo establecido, tienes que encontrar una manera que sea un buen balance. Y si no puedes encontrar un buen tiempo el cual retar a los jugadores, para eso est\u00e1n las tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n - Convi\u00e9rtelo en una competici\u00f3n! De hecho, algunos de tus celebridades favoritas del mundo del speedrun podr\u00edan venir a este sitio y meter uno que otro tiempo.   Tu sabes cuando un logro te esta metiendo presi\u00f3n cuando te empiezan a sudar las manos y te encuentras nervioso mientras observas y observas el reloj. Como dije anteriormente, nada grita mas fuerte, \"Despierta!\" que un timer, especialmente cuando los desarrolladores empiezan a\u00f1adir este tipo de logros con OTROS tipos de logros (e incluso tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n) durante una secci\u00f3n contrarreloj del juego. Los Retos de Tiempo tienen una sinergia muy grande con otros tipos de logros.",

Sitios web basados en juegos en especifico son un recurso fant\u00e1stico para encontrar estos tipos de logros ellos tienen una muy buena idea de que es posible y que es imposible, e inclusive han asta escrito FAQs discutiendo retos alternos y maneras diferente de jugar el juego.

Iconos y badges tienen que ser hechos de una manera que sean claros en 32x32 ya que son normalmente reducidas a este tama\u00f1o, como en el feed global de notificaciones.\n\n\n\n\nSubiendo Iconos de Juegos (Desarrollador)\nlink\n\n\nLos desarrolladores de logros tienen permitido cambiar iconos de juegos en entradas que no cuenten con logros. Como desarrollador si tu quieres postear un respaldo de la antigua imagen eres libre de hacerlo pero no es realmente un requisito. Mientras creas un nuevo set de logros tu eres libre de crear o escoger que icono quieres para el juego.\n\n\nPara cambiar el Icono de un juego primero ve a la pagina del juego y haz click en Dev tools:\n\n\n\n\nLuego haz click en el bot\u00f3n de choose file que se encuentra resaltado. Encuentra el archivo en tu PC, y luego presiona el bot\u00f3n resaltado de submit:\n\n\n\n\nSi un juego que ya cuenta con logros el cambio de Icono tiene que pasar por medio de \nIcon Gauntlet\n.\n\n\nSubiendo Iconos de Juegos (no-Desarrollador)\nlink\n\n\nSi, absolutamente puedes, pero recuerda leer las regla de \nIcon Gauntlet\n. Tambien seria bueno darle un vistazo a las reglas de \ndise\u00f1o para nuevos iconos de juegos\n.\n\n\nGame Icon Gauntlet\nlink\n\n\nEl game Icon Gauntlet enfrenta un icono posteado por un usuario en una pelea \ncara-a-cara\n con el icono actual. El \nvoto popular\n es lo que toma lugar en \n#Icon-Gauntlet\n este canal de Discord es lo que determina que se queda y que se va. Todos los usuarios verificados de Discord son elegibles de ingresar su voto. \nSpawncalibur\n es el administrador en todos los aspectos de esta din\u00e1mica.\n\n\nReglas para proponer un nuevo icono de juego\nlink\n\n\n\n\nCualquier usuario verificado de RetroAchievments puede subir un nuevo icono de juego.\n\n\nSolo proponer iconos para juegos que ya cuentan con logros.\n\n\nPropuestas de iconos tienen que estar relacionadas con el juego, no gr\u00e1ficos nuevos.\n\n\nRecomendado:\n Iconos se ven mejor creados en 96x96, 64x64 o 32x32. Crea una imagen PNG en formato para mejores resultados.\n\n\nPosteala en \neste tema del foro\n.\n\n\nPara mostrar la imagen apropiadamente posteala utilizando el tag de foro \n[img=http://YourImageURL.png]\n\n\nDeja en claro cual es el juego el cual quieres que tu icono quiere remplazar. (Incluso mejor si utilizas el tag del foro de \n[game=GameID]\n. Puedes encontrar el ID del juego viendo el URL de la pagina de este)\n\n\n\n\nLa votaci\u00f3n en Icon Gauntlet\nlink\n\n\n\n\nEl voto toma lugar en el canal de Discord de \n#Icon-Gauntlet\n y esta abierto a todos los usuarios de Discord Verificados (usuarios de Discord con \n(nombre verde)\n)\n\n\nNuevas votaciones son posteadas semanalmente y duran una semana.\n\n\nSe gana por mayor\u00eda de votos.\n\n\nSi pasa un empate van a suceder unas re-votaciones.\n\n\n\n\nQue pasa con la imagen cuando subes el icono de un juego\nlink\n\n\nCuando se sube, tu imagen es reducida a un PNG de 32-bits colores y a un tama\u00f1o de 96x96. Si subes un icono que sea mas peque\u00f1o que 96x96 la imagen va a retener su tama\u00f1o original. \n\n\nLo mismo pasa para los Badges, excepto que el tama\u00f1o maximo para los badges es de 64x64. (El de Imagenes de Perfil es de \n 128x128.)\n\n\nServidores de los Archivos de Iconos\nlink\n\n\nLos Iconos son almacenados en el sitio de la siguiente manera y lugar: \ni.retroachievements.org/Images/000705.png\n. Ellos son almacenados en el mismo folder donde se almac\u00e9n todas las dem\u00e1s im\u00e1genes como las caratulas y las screenshots por ejemplo. \n\n\nBadges de Logros\nlink\n\n\nLos Badges (Emblemas) son las imagenes creadas por el usuario para cada logro en individuo de un juego.\n\n\n\n\nSonic the Hedgehog's primer Badge - #00199)\n\n  ## \n\n\n\n\nGu\u00edas y Tips en la Creaci\u00f3n de Badges\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLos Badges tienen que estar relacionados con lo que se trate el logro - por ejemplo: la foto de un jefe, nivel o coleccionable que requiere que el jugador consiga. \n\n\nCheca dise\u00f1os de varios de tus juegos favoritos. Algunos usuarios ponen un gran esfuerzo en crear badges realmente atractivos:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAqu\u00ed esta un \ntema del foro\n lleno de grandes tips. \n\n\nEn el caso de logros de juegos de muy baja-resoluci\u00f3n, puede ser dificil conseguir que un badge que se mire bien y que este no se mira \ntosco\n o \nborroso\n, en estos casos un look mas \ntosco\n es mucho mas preferible, ya que las im\u00e1genes tiene esa sensaci\u00f3n \nretro\n en ellas.\n\n\nPuedes hacer que cada Badge tengan un peque\u00f1os bordes pandeados como un Badge/Emblema actual o algunos bordes extras punteados para mas \u00e9nfasis o una corona de rey para los mas dif\u00edciles.  Es tu dise\u00f1o.  Deber\u00eda de presentar el logro de una manera visual, o que sea una pista para evadir secretos del juego.\n\n\nEstar a la par con el estilo de arte del juego tambi\u00e9n funciona bien. Buscar en Google Image \"Sprite Sheets\" es tambi\u00e9n otro \u00fatil tip para incluir alg\u00fan arte del juego.\n\n\n\n\nTama\u00f1o y Archivo del Badge - mejores practicas\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLos badges que se suban tienen que ser cuadrados (tener las misma dimensi\u00f3n X y Y), de otra manera la imagen resultar\u00eda distorsionada y fea.\n\n\nSubir im\u00e1genes PNG en formato no-entrelazado; evita utilizar una capa de transparencia ya que va a salir un fondo blanco en el.\n\n\nDise\u00f1a im\u00e1genes en 64x64, 48x48 o 32x32 por la mejor calidad. Los logros se tienen que hacer de una manera que la tem\u00e1tica se sea clara incluso en 32x32, ya que son reducidas a este tama\u00f1o com\u00fanmente en el sitio, como en el feed global de notificaciones.\n\n\n\n\nSubiendo Badges (Desarrollador)\nlink\n\n\nSi te encuentras creando logros eres libre de subir badges para ellos. \n\n\nLos Badges se suben con las herramientas de desarrollador del emulador por medio del editor de logros:\n\n\n\n\nO tambi\u00e9n puedes seleccionar una imagen prefabricada o encontrar otras im\u00e1genes que haz subido por medio de la lista desglosable:\n\n\n\n\nSubir archivos \n.jpg\n, \n.jpg\n o \n.gif\n. No es completamente importante el formato, pero si es completamente recomendable que la imagen sea cuadrada.\n\n\nSi el juego ya cuenta con badges existentes \u00e9chale una checada y sigue el procedimiento para \nSubiendo Badges (No-Desarrollador)\n.\n\n\nSubiendo Badges (No-Desarrollador)\nlink\n\n\nPostea todas las im\u00e1genes nuevas que quieres remplazar en el foro oficial del juego. Tambi\u00e9n enlista cuales badges quieres remplazar. Un desarrollador o un moderador va a evaluar tu trabajo y decidir si, s\u00ed ser\u00e1n remplazados. Si as\u00ed lo deciden se posteara un respaldo de los iconos actuales en el foro, y tambi\u00e9n se remplazaran por los nuevos.\n\n\nEste respaldo es necesario si llega a existir el caso en el que hay desacuerdos con los nuevos badges. En estos casos algunos o todos los badges podr\u00edan ser revertidos a los anteriores.\n\n\nEs mas f\u00e1cil hacer una referencia a los viejos y nuevos badges como links de \nimg\n:\n- ejemplo: \n[img=https://retroachievements.org/Badge/01234.png] -> [img=https://retroachievements.org/badge/56789.png]\n\n- (Dev) percatate de capturar los antiguos ID de los badges del Editor de Logros antes de subir los nuevos\n- El ID de los nuevos badges aparecer\u00e1n en el Editor de Logros despu\u00e9s de que sean subidos.\n- ambos valores tambi\u00e9n pueden ser capturados desde el sitio web, pero tienes que copiar el link de la imagen como el hover link del logro.\n\n\nAqu\u00ed hay un ejemplo perfecto de \ncomo hacer un respaldo apropiado de Badges reci\u00e9n cambiados\n.\n\n\nQue pasa con la imagen cuando subes un Badge\nlink\n\n\nCuando se sube, tu archivo es convertido a lo siguiente:\n- 64x64 PNG de 32-bit de color. Ejemplo:\n\n\n![00136](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8508804/37221161-b9b0bb02-23a7-11e8-81b2-3d09fa7456af.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64x64 PNG borroso y con escala de grises. Ejemplo:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServidor de los Archivos de Badges\nlink\n\n\nEstos se almacenan en el sitio de la siguiente manera y lugar: \ni.retroachievements.org/Badge/00136.png\n; el numero coincide con el ID de Badges que se encuentra con el Editor de Logros.\n\n\nDonde se muestran los Badges e Iconos\nlink\n\n\n\n\nEn tablas de Clasificacion: 96x96 (Solamente Iconos)\n\n\nEn emuladores de RA: 64x64\n\n\nPaginas de Juego: 64x64\n\n\nPaginas de Usuarios: 48x48\n\n\nActualmente jugando/Rich Presence y en el Feed Global: 32x32\n\n\n\n\nLa im\u00e1genes actuales no se les cambia el tama\u00f1o. La imagen es escalada por el navegador al tama\u00f1o correspondiente. Algunos navegadores como el de Android muestran de una manera mas clara las im\u00e1genes mas grandes. Tambi\u00e9n puedes aumentar el zoom de tu navegador para ver aun mas claro.\n\n\nSe espera que en la versi\u00f3n futura del sitio, los Iconos y Badges se muestren en tama\u00f1o completo en otros lugares.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-05-15 10:10] eldexterr:\n Updated Badge and Icon Creation es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-15 10:06] eldexterr:\n Updated Badge and Icon Creation es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-15 09:58] eldexterr:\n Updated Badge and Icon Creation es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-12 16:01] eldexterr:\n Updated Badge and Icon Creation es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-04-18 17:26] eldexterr:\n Document created but still not finished",

            "text": "Actualmente las Tablas de Clasificaci\u00f3n pueden ser editadas por desarrolladores desde el sitio web. Es una interfaz bastante tosca y un trabajo algo complicado hacer que una tabla funcione de manera correcta. As\u00ed que en este documento vamos a intentar a entender como funciona.\n\n\nVisiones Generales\nlink\n\n\nAsi es como se ve una lista de Tablas de Clasificaci\u00f3n de un juego en el sitio web:\n\n\n\n\nEn el centro puedes llegar a ver cada Tabla que a sido creada, y en la columna de la derecha puedes llegar a ver las \nNotas de C\u00f3digo\n del Juego. Las Notas est\u00e1n all\u00ed para ayudar en algunas de las condiciones que se encuentran aqu\u00ed abajo.\n\n\nAqu\u00ed hay una breve explicaci\u00f3n de cada campo que se encuentra en una Tabla de Clasificacion:\n\n\n\n\nTitulo\n: El titulo de la tabla.\n\n\nDescripci\u00f3n\n: La descripci\u00f3n de la tabla.\n\n\nFormato\n: Puede llegar a ser \nPuntuaci\u00f3n\n, \nTiempo (Frames)\n, \nTiempo (Milisegundos)\n o \nValor\n. Se utiliza para distinguir que tipo de tabla es (vamos a ver mas sobre esto mas abajo).\n\n\n\"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox\n: cuando se encuentra activada, significa que el valor mas bajo es mejor. Es usualmente el caso para logros basados en tiempo.\n\n\nStart\n: condiciones para empezar la tabla, aka \nSTA\n.\n\n\nCancel\n: condiciones para cancelar la tabla, aka \nCAN\n.\n\n\nSubmit\n: condiciones para subir una entrada a la tabla, aka \nSUB\n.\n\n\nValue\n: valor que quieres que se suba a la tabla, aka \nVAL\n.\n\n\n\n\nNota\n: Una tabla valida TIENE que tener todas estas cuatro condiciones.\n\n\nEsos \u00faltimos 4 campos son realmente importantes y se tiene que tomar \nMUCHO\n cuidado de acuerdo a los datos que vas a introducir en ellas. Es por eso que requieren una explicaci\u00f3n a continuaci\u00f3n:\n\n\nLa condici\u00f3n \nSTA\n o \nStart\n son una serie de valores, como un logro, que tienen que llegar a ser verdad en orden para que la tabla empieza a buscar una entrada para la tabla. Una vez que \nSTA\n es verdadero, el juego va a activar las otras tres constantemente.\n\n\nSi la condici\u00f3n \nCancel\n (\nCAN\n) es verdadera, entonces esta va a cancelar la tabla y no se va a subir la entrada a la misma. \n\n\nSi la condici\u00f3n \nSubmit\n (\nSUB\n) es verdadera, entonces la puntuaci\u00f3n entrara en las tablas. NOTA: Cancel tiene mas prioridad que Submit. Si las dos se convierten verdaderas en el mismo frame, la puntuaci\u00f3n no sera ingresada.\n\n\nFinalmente, \nValue\n (\nVAL\n) es un caso especial, y va a ser tomado de la memoria utilizando la formula que se ingreso en la entrada de Value. Esta es la puntuaci\u00f3n que se muestra cuando la Tabla esta activa, y el valor que es ingresado en las tablas si \nSUB\n es verdadero.\n\n\nNOTA: Una vez que una tabla activa es cancelada o ingresada, esta no puede ser re-activada asta que la condici\u00f3n \nStart\n se convierta en falsa, y verdadera de nuevo. Esto previene a la tabla de ser re-activada inmediatamente que se ingreso un valor o se cancelo.\n\n\nFormato de Direcciones\nlink\n\n\nLas direcciones de memoria para STA/CAN/SUB/VAL tienen el siguiente formato:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocalizaci\u00f3n/tama\u00f1o\n\n\nprefijo (las letras pueden ser en min\u00fasculas)\n\n\nejemplo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit0\n\n\n0xM\n\n\n0xM01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit1\n\n\n0xN\n\n\n0xN01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit2\n\n\n0xO\n\n\n0xO01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit3\n\n\n0xP\n\n\n0xP01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit4\n\n\n0xQ\n\n\n0xQ01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit5\n\n\n0xR\n\n\n0xR01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit6\n\n\n0xS\n\n\n0xS01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit7\n\n\n0xT\n\n\n0xT01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower4\n\n\n0xL\n\n\n0xL01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper4\n\n\n0xU\n\n\n0xU01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8bit\n\n\n0xH\n\n\n0xH01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16bit\n\n\n0x\n\n\n0x01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32bit\n\n\n0xX\n\n\n0xX01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEjemplo\nlink\n\n\nLa mejor manera de empezar es hecharle un vistazo a una de las tablas ya existentes \nhttps://retroachievements.org/leaderboardList.php\n y abrirla para ver como funciona. Vamos a utilizar la tabla de \nGreen Hill Act 1 (Sonic the Hedgehog)\n para este ejemplo. Entonces veamos como funciona:\n\n\n\n\nEl \nTitulo/Descripci\u00f3n\n son algo obios.\n\n\nEl \nType\n es \"Time (Frames)\". En Sonic cada 60 frames es un 1 segundo, entonces vamos a monitoriar los segundo utilizando frames.\n\n\nLa caja de \nLower Is Better\n esta marcada, entonces aquel que consiga el tiempo mas corto sera el #1.\n\n\nAhora vamos a desglosar las partes mas importantes.\n\n\nCondiciones de Start\nlink\n\n\nSTA\n: \n0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10=h0000\n: Si la direcci\u00f3n de 16-bit 0xfe10 en la RAM es equivalente a 0000 en hex,\n\n\n_\n: Y,\n\n\n0xhf601=h0c\n: Si la direcci\u00f3n de 8-bit 0xf601 en la RAM es equivalente a 0c en hex,\n\n\n_\n: Y,\n\n\nd0xhf601!=h0c\n: Si la misma direcci\u00f3n anterior (0xf601) NO es equivalente a 0c en hex,\n\n\n_\n: Y,\n\n\n0xfff0=0\n Si la direcci\u00f3n de 16-bit 0xfff0 en la RAM es equivalente a 0.\n\n\n\n\nEsto puede parecer desalentador, porque no sabes que significan esta direcciones. Es por eso que las \nNotas de C\u00f3digo\n en la columna de la derecha son bastante \u00fatiles! Tu puedes llegar a ver como estas direcciones son mostradas en memoria. En nuestro ejemplo tenemos:\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10\n es el nivel, y se espera que sea \n0\n (el primer nivel).\n\n\n0xf601\n es una direccion en memoria de 8-bit, y utilizamos el prefijo \n0xh\n en vez de \n0x\n. \n0xf601\n es el modo de la pantalla. La segunda y terceras partes de las condiciones para empezar estan diciendo \"el modo actual tiene que ser  \ningame\n (\n0c\n), y el modo en el frame anterior NO tiene que ser \ningame\n\". \nNota\n: ese prefijo \nd\n en la direcci\u00f3n representa delta, o \"el valor en el frame anterior\". \nSum\u00e1ndole a esto:\n ejecuta STA si ACABAMOS de llegar a un nivel, (para empezar a checar el tiempo).\n\n\nFinalmente tambi\u00e9n esperamos que \n0xfff0\n sea equivalente a \n0\n, ya que esta direcci\u00f3n se utiliza para demo mode, y no queremos que la tabla se active cuando esta el modo demo activado!\n\n\n\n\nTip\n: el error mas com\u00fan cuando creamos tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n es olvidarnos de la \nh\n cuando tratamos de hacer referencia a un valor en memoria de 8-bit.\n\n\nPro-tip:\n \nSTA\n, \nCAN\n, y \nSUB\n soportan toda la logica que se encuentra disponible en el \neditor de logros\n. La manera mas facil es asegurarte que escribiste todo correctamente es crear logros locales que capturen estos eventos, y entonces extraer los valores ingresados en el archivo \"XXX-User.txt\" asociado al juego en el cual te encuentras trabajando.\n\n\nCondiciones para Cancelar\nlink\n\n\nCAN\n: \n0xhfe13<d0xhfe13\n\n\n\n\n0xfe13 es el numero de vidas.\n\n\n\n\nLa condici\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n checa si el contador de VIDAS alguna vez se decrementa. Literalmente dice \"Cancela si el valor ACTUAL en 0xfe13 es menor al valor ANTERIOR en 0xfe13\". Queremos hacer esto porque puedes llegar al ultimo checkpoint, morir y resetear tu tiempo a 0:00. Y no queremos que se pueda hacer esto, ya que no es la manera correcta de completar el nivel. As\u00ed que si el jugador muere, se va a resetear el progreso de la tabla. Finalmente, si conectas dos condiciones de cancelaci\u00f3n con una \ns\n, la tabla se va a cancelar si cualquiera de las condiciones es verdadera.\n\n\nCondiciones para Ingresar Entradas\nlink\n\n\nSUB\n: \n0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0\n\n\n\n\n0xf7cc es la bandera para terminar el nivel, esta no es interactiva.\n\n\n\n\nLa secci\u00f3n de submit checa si en el frame actual se encuentra la bandera de 'endlevel' como verdadera (o \n!=0\n, 'no es un cero'), y el frame anterior (delta) lo tiene como falso (o \n=0\n, 'cero'). Esto sugiere que el jugador a llegado al final del nivel.\n\n\nTip\n: puede llegar a ser \u00fatil observar como trabajan estos valores en memoria, y conocer que tipo de valor se utilizan en diferente circunstancias.\n\n\nInterpretador de Valores\nlink\n\n\nTambi\u00e9n mira: \nC\u00f3digo Binario Formateado en Decimal\n\n\nVAL\n: \n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nFinalmente, valor. Una vez que el jugador a llegado a la condici\u00f3n de inicio, se mostrara una notificaci\u00f3n en pantalla, mostrando el progreso del jugador en tiempo real. Si es una una tabla sobre tiempo, va a ver un reloj, y si es una puntuaci\u00f3n se mostrara simplemente el valor. Si ellos llegan a cumplir la condici\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n, se mostrara un mensaje diciendo que fallaron, y la notificaci\u00f3n sera removida. Si ellos cumplen la condici\u00f3n de submit exitosamente, el valor actual se va a tomar y se va a subir una entrada, aparecer\u00e1 una notificaci\u00f3n informando al jugador sobre su posici\u00f3n en las tablas.\n\n\nLa condiciones en value son especiales en cierto aspectos. Es evaluada constantemente y se muestra en pantalla en tiempo real cuando una tabla esta activada. No trabaja como otras condiciones, interpreta las direcciones de la siguiente manera:\n\n\ndirecci\u00f3n*modificador\n (direcci\u00f3n veces modificador)\n\n\ny usa al \n_\n operador guion bajo como 'mas'. El asterisco \n*\n significa 'multiplicar', entonces en el valor\n\n\n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nrepresenta:\n\n\n8-bit 0xfe24 1 vez, MAS\n8-bit 0xfe25 60 veces, MAS\n8-bit 0xfe22 3600 veces\n\n\nLa raz\u00f3n de esto es que los valores de cada una de estas direcciones significan frames, segundos, y minutos respectivamente. Cuando agregamos estos valor juntos, obtenemos un total de frames que ingresamos a la base de datos.\n\n\nRecuerdas que el campo de 'Formato' pod\u00eda ya ser \nPuntuaci\u00f3n\n, \nTiempo (Frames)\n, \nTiempo (Milisegundos)\n o \nValor\n? \nTiempo (Frames)\n es el mas com\u00fan de todos, y representa 'frames'. \nTime (Milisegundos)\n espera un valor que pueda convertir en milisegundos (Super Mario Kart utiliza esto). Sin embargo para convertir un valor en frames a un formato que sea humanamente entendible tenemos que dividir el valor por 60 para conseguir una interpretaci\u00f3n certera de los segundos, y un valor en milisegundos deber\u00eda estar dividido por 100 para conseguir el numero de milisegundos. Esto se utiliza ya sea en el sitio web y en los programas para mostrar el valor apropiadamente, y es importante que se distinga ya que podemos estar seguros que estamos consiguiendo el valor mas acertado del emulador, utilizando el formato que sea necesario para capturar el tiempo.\n\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay un s\u00edmbolo que solamente funciona en este campo. Conecta dos valores condicionales con un \n$\n y esto va a provocar que solamente se utilice el valor con tenga el valor mas alto.\n\n\nNOTA\n: \nTiempo (Milisegundos)\n son actualmente centenas de segundo, no mil\u00e9simas de segundo. por ejemplo: un valor de  6234 deber\u00eda de ser 62.34 segundos, no 6.234 segundos.\n\n\nTip\n: el modificador usa valores decimales, entonces si por ejemplo quieres divir entre dos, puedes multiplicar por  0.5: \n0xhfe24*0.5\n\n\nAyuda Futura\nlink\n\n\nDesafortunadamente hay \nMUCHAS\n maneras de llegar a hacer este proceso de la manera equivocada, entonces si llegas a tener alg\u00fan problema si\u00e9ntete libre de pedir ayuda en nuestro \nServidor de Discord\n.\n\n\nSi quieres practicar, es bastante recomendable que crees tu tabla e intentes algo en un juego nuevo, en vez de utilizar una tabla ya existente.\n\n\nPor favor ten en cuenta que estos archivos son arrastrados directamente a la partida de alguien cuando abra el juego, y un valor de memoria mal ingresado o un comando puede causar que el emulador se crashee, as\u00ed que por favor testea el c\u00f3digo de tu tabla!\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-05-17 10:24] eldexterr:\n Updated Leaderboards es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-16 11:31] eldexterr:\n Updated Leaderboards es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-16 10:56] eldexterr:\n Updated Leaderboards es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-15 10:21] eldexterr:\n Updated Leaderboards (markdown)",

Una vez que  STA  es verdadero, el juego va a activar las otras tres constantemente.  Si la condici\u00f3n  Cancel  ( CAN ) es verdadera, entonces esta va a cancelar la tabla y no se va a subir la entrada a la misma.   Si la condici\u00f3n  Submit  ( SUB ) es verdadera, entonces la puntuaci\u00f3n entrara en las tablas. NOTA: Cancel tiene mas prioridad que Submit. Si las dos se convierten verdaderas en el mismo frame, la puntuaci\u00f3n no sera ingresada.  Finalmente,  Value  ( VAL ) es un caso especial, y va a ser tomado de la memoria utilizando la formula que se ingreso en la entrada de Value. Esta es la puntuaci\u00f3n que se muestra cuando la Tabla esta activa, y el valor que es ingresado en las tablas si  SUB  es verdadero.  NOTA: Una vez que una tabla activa es cancelada o ingresada, esta no puede ser re-activada asta que la condici\u00f3n  Start  se convierta en falsa, y verdadera de nuevo. Esto previene a la tabla de ser re-activada inmediatamente que se ingreso un valor o se cancelo.",

Esto puede parecer desalentador, porque no sabes que significan esta direcciones. Es por eso que las  Notas de C\u00f3digo  en la columna de la derecha son bastante \u00fatiles! Tu puedes llegar a ver como estas direcciones son mostradas en memoria. En nuestro ejemplo tenemos:   0xfe10  es el nivel, y se espera que sea  0  (el primer nivel).  0xf601  es una direccion en memoria de 8-bit, y utilizamos el prefijo  0xh  en vez de  0x .  0xf601  es el modo de la pantalla.

Nota : ese prefijo  d  en la direcci\u00f3n representa delta, o \"el valor en el frame anterior\".  Sum\u00e1ndole a esto:  ejecuta STA si ACABAMOS de llegar a un nivel, (para empezar a checar el tiempo).  Finalmente tambi\u00e9n esperamos que  0xfff0  sea equivalente a  0 , ya que esta direcci\u00f3n se utiliza para demo mode, y no queremos que la tabla se active cuando esta el modo demo activado!   Tip : el error mas com\u00fan cuando creamos tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n es olvidarnos de la  h  cuando tratamos de hacer referencia a un valor en memoria de 8-bit.  Pro-tip:   STA ,  CAN , y  SUB  soportan toda la logica que se encuentra disponible en el  editor de logros . La manera mas facil es asegurarte que escribiste todo correctamente es crear logros locales que capturen estos eventos, y entonces extraer los valores ingresados en el archivo \"XXX-User.txt\" asociado al juego en el cual te encuentras trabajando.",

Si es una una tabla sobre tiempo, va a ver un reloj, y si es una puntuaci\u00f3n se mostrara simplemente el valor. Si ellos llegan a cumplir la condici\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n, se mostrara un mensaje diciendo que fallaron, y la notificaci\u00f3n sera removida. Si ellos cumplen la condici\u00f3n de submit exitosamente, el valor actual se va a tomar y se va a subir una entrada, aparecer\u00e1 una notificaci\u00f3n informando al jugador sobre su posici\u00f3n en las tablas.  La condiciones en value son especiales en cierto aspectos. Es evaluada constantemente y se muestra en pantalla en tiempo real cuando una tabla esta activada.

Cuando agregamos estos valor juntos, obtenemos un total de frames que ingresamos a la base de datos.  Recuerdas que el campo de 'Formato' pod\u00eda ya ser  Puntuaci\u00f3n ,  Tiempo (Frames) ,  Tiempo (Milisegundos)  o  Valor ?  Tiempo (Frames)  es el mas com\u00fan de todos, y representa 'frames'.  Time (Milisegundos)  espera un valor que pueda convertir en milisegundos (Super Mario Kart utiliza esto). Sin embargo para convertir un valor en frames a un formato que sea humanamente entendible tenemos que dividir el valor por 60 para conseguir una interpretaci\u00f3n certera de los segundos, y un valor en milisegundos deber\u00eda estar dividido por 100 para conseguir el numero de milisegundos. Esto se utiliza ya sea en el sitio web y en los programas para mostrar el valor apropiadamente, y es importante que se distinga ya que podemos estar seguros que estamos consiguiendo el valor mas acertado del emulador, utilizando el formato que sea necesario para capturar el tiempo.  Tambi\u00e9n hay un s\u00edmbolo que solamente funciona en este campo. Conecta dos valores condicionales con un  $  y esto va a provocar que solamente se utilice el valor con tenga el valor mas alto.  NOTA :  Tiempo (Milisegundos)  son actualmente centenas de segundo, no mil\u00e9simas de segundo. por ejemplo: un valor de  6234 deber\u00eda de ser 62.34 segundos, no 6.234 segundos.  Tip : el modificador usa valores decimales, entonces si por ejemplo quieres divir entre dos, puedes multiplicar por  0.5:  0xhfe24*0.5",

El Script checa la memoria del juego y ya sea como esta fue programada reporta los valores de ciertas direcciones con definiciones asignadas por el desarrollador as\u00ed como en que stage se encuentra el jugador, cuantas vidas tienes, si el juego esta en pausa, que modo de juego se encuentra jugando, lo que a logrado el jugador, etc. Esta informacion es reportada de vuelta al sitio. \nCada juego publicado deber\u00eda de tener m\u00ednimo un RPS b\u00e1sico.\n\n\nEjemplo de RP en acci\u00f3n:\n\n\n  \n\n\nPara ver la RP en tiempo real haz clic en el menu de RetroAchievements en tu emulador y despu\u00e9s en Rich Presence Monitor.

Similarmente, cada 120 segundos o parecido, la caja de 'active players' en la pagina de inicio se va a refrescar, detallando la ultima actividad conocida por todos los jugadores activos.

Si la siguiente linea empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, se considera como un display con una string condicional. La parte de la linea que se encuentra entre los dos signos de interrogaci\u00f3n es la clausula de la condici\u00f3n. Si la clausula de la condici\u00f3n se eval\u00faa y esta es verdadera, entonces la siguiente parte de la linea se utiliza como el string del display. Si esta no se eval\u00faa como verdadera, entonces se procede a la siguiente linea. Si esta empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, entonces el mismo proceso se repite. Si este no empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, la linea entera se utiliza como el string default para el display.\n\n\nNOTA\n: Se requiere una string default en caso de que ninguna de tus strings condicionales sean verdaderas. Si solamente cuentas con strings condicionales, el script no va a hacer nada.\n\n\nObservando este ejemplo, si el valor de 16-bit en $0085 es igual a 0, el string del display sera \nTitle Screen\n. Si no, la siguiente linea es examinada. Si el 7mo bit de $007C es igual a 1, el string del display sera \nMapa Personalizado en @Zona(0xH00016c)\n. Si no entonces, como linea final no cuenta con una clausula condicional esta es utilizada.\n\n\nStrings de Display asociados con una clausula condicional soportan todo la misma sintaxis que el string de display predeterminado. En este ejemplo, puedes ver que el lookup \n@Zona\n se utiliza en los dos strings condicionales y en el string predeterminado. \n\n\nLa frase condicional soporta todos los asesores de direcciones previamente mencionados as\u00ed como la l\u00f3gica de los AND (_) y OR (S). Nota: las clausulas OR aun requieren un grupo 'core', \nas\u00ed como en los logros\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?0xH1234=32_0xH2345=0?ejemplo y\n\n\nsi el valor de 8-bit en $1234 es 32 \ny\n el valor de 8-bit en $2345 is 0, muestra \nejemplo y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?0xH1234=32S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?ejemplo o\n\n\nsi el valor de 8-bit en $1234 es 32 \ny\n el valor de 8-bit en $2345 es 1 \no\n 2, muestra \nejemplo o\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?0xH1234=32_0xH5678=33S0xH2345=1S0xH2345=2?ejemplo y/o\n\n\nsi el valor de 8-bit en $1234 es 32 \ny\n el valor de 8-bit en $5678 es 33 \ny\n el valor de 8-bit en $2345 es 1 \no\n 2, muestra \nejemplo y/o\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\u00f3digo Binario programado en Decimal (BCD)\nlink\n\n\nBCD es cuando cuando los valores son almacenados en una direcci\u00f3n del 0-9 (un d\u00edgito) o 0-99 (dos d\u00edgitos). ten en mente que la mayor\u00eda de las veces los valores son almacenados en hexadecimal, pero algunas veces los juegos los almacenan de esta manera y aqu\u00ed esta el mejor m\u00e9todo para trabajar con este tipo de valores en tu display.\n\n\nBCD decodifica cada car\u00e1cter hexadecimal como un d\u00edgito decimal. Si el inspector de memoria muestra un 86 (en hex), el resulta de BCD decodificando el valor seria un 86 (en decimal).\n\n\nPara objectos con estos valores puedes utilizar le prefijo BCD, como aqu\u00ed \nb0xh1234\n. Esto tambi\u00e9n funciona con \nvalores en tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n\n.\nTen en cuenta que tambi\u00e9n vas a necesitar especificar el tama\u00f1o de la direcci\u00f3n BCD en memoria. \nb0x1234\n lee un valor de  16-bit. \nb0xh1234\n lee un valor de 8-bit y \nb0xX1234\n lee un valor de 32-bit.\n\nNOTA\n: Soporte para decodificacion BCD de 16-bit y 32-bit es una funci\u00f3n para el kit de desarrollo 0.075.\n\n\nEsto es usualmente usado para puntuaciones y tiempo, pero algunas veces tambi\u00e9n para otros tipos de valores.\n\n\nLimites\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLimite de 16,000 caracteres por script  \n\n\nLimite de 100 caracteres para lo que se esta mostrando\n\n\nCaracteres Unicode son permitidos\n\n\n\n\nDetalles de la Sintaxis\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLas llaves para Lookups son en decimal por default y hex si agregas el prefijo \n0x\n. Esto significa \n1\n == \n0x1\n, \n2\n == \n0x2\n, \n9\n == \n0x9\n, \n10\n == \n0xa\n, \n100\n == \n0x64\n, etc.  \n\n\nLos nombres para Lookup/Format son sensibles entre may\u00fasculas y min\u00fasculas por lo que necesitas escribir exactamente igual el nombre para que se muestre correctamente en el string del display: \n@test(0x1234)\n el cual no va a encontrar \"Format:Test\"\n\n\nUn Lookup/Format no pueden contener espacios antes o despu\u00e9s del nombre. \n@test(0x1234)\n no va a encontrar \"Format:test   \" o \"Format:   test\"\n\n\nSi tu Lookup/Format no puede ser encontrado, no se va a mostrar nada. \nEsta es una prueba @test(0x1234).\n va a salir como \nEsto es una .\n si \ntest\n no puede ser encontrado.\n\n\nSe pueden agregar comentarios en cualquier parte del script. Una doble diagonal (\n//\n) indica que la parte restante de la linea va a ser ignorada cuando se procese el script. Nota: los comentarios tambi\u00e9n aplican para el tama\u00f1o m\u00e1ximo de caracteres del script.\n\n\n\n\nTips y Trucos\nlink\n\n\n\n\nLos nombres de los Lookup pueden ser tan cortos como un solo car\u00e1cter si necesitas ahorrarte algunos caracteres extras.\n\n\nZeros subsecuentes pueden ser eliminados de las direcciones (\n0xh0001\n puede ser acortado a \n0xh1\n).\n\n\nConvertir todos tus valores de hex a decimal va tomar muchos menos caracteres.\n\n\nCaracteres Unicode no siempre \"toman menos espacio\" ellos usualmente toman hasta cuatro caracteres del sistema.\n\n\nSi un lookup no contiene ning\u00fan valor mapeados, va a resultar en un valor (sin espacio) en blanco. Puedes cambiar este comportamiento agregando una sola linea a los valores del lookup, '*' a el valor que deseas.\n\n\nCada \nLookup\n o \nFormat\n puede ser cargado m\u00faltiples veces con las mismas o diferentes direcciones. Puedes definir un solo \nFormat:Number FormatType=VALUE\n en vez de definir valores individuales para las vidas, Puntuaci\u00f3n, Nivel, etc.\n\n\nPoner espacios a tus lookups algunas veces antes o despues puede ayudarte a esconder ciertos lookups cuando estos no son requeridos, como lo hacen \n@Pause\n, \n@Star\n, \n@Swimming\n, y @Mode . \n\n\n\n\nPropiedades de los Valores\nlink\n\n\nCuando utilizamos objetos lookup y format \n@object()\n es posible combinar y hacer c\u00e1lculos. Esto puede ser utilizado para mostrar una puntuaci\u00f3n correctamente, tiempo del juego, etc. o hacen lookups avanzados.\n\n\nEjemplo\n\n\n@Puntuaci\u00f3n(0x28*10_0x29*1000_0x26*100000) puntos\n \n\n\nEsto significa utiliza el lookup o Format \nPuntuaci\u00f3n\n, y entrega la suma de:\n\n- 0x28 10 veces, AGREGA\n- 0x29 1000 veces, AGREGA\n\n- 0x26 100000 veces\n\n\n\n\n_\n agregas las direcciones mutuamente.  \n\n\nO tambi\u00e9n puedes agregar un valor est\u00e1tico \n0x28_v10\n. Esto agrega un 10 a tu total, as\u00ed como el valor de \n0x28\n + 10 puede ser mostrado. Tambi\u00e9n se puede hacer lo mismo pero restando \n0x28_v-10.\n  \n\n\nSi lo que quieres es restar una direcci\u00f3n necesitas multiplicar el valor por -1. \n0x29*-1\n. \n0x29\n es ahora negativo.  \n\n\nSi lo que quieres es hacer una divisi\u00f3n lo que necesitas es multiplicar por un numero quebrado. \n0x26*.5\n. \n0x26\n va a mostrar el valor 1/2 de \n0x26\n.  \n\n\nY as\u00ed puedes crear un string con todo junto: \n0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10\n.\n\n\nTambi\u00e9n puedes agregar direcciones entre si para agregar a tus lookups de acuerdo a la suma de varias direcciones. Esto es utilizado en el ejemplo de @Star. Esta buscando la suma de los 6 bits mas bajos de la direcci\u00f3n 0xh79f. La manera en la que esta direcci\u00f3n trabaja es que mientras se encuentre un valor hay significa que Mario es invisible porque agarro una estrella y cuenta el valor hex en 0x23 (35 en decimal) a 0. 23 en binario es 0010 0011 significando que la suma m\u00e1xima de estos bits seria 5 durante 0001 1111 cuando el contador llega al valor hex de 0x1f (31 en decimal).\n\n\n\n\nS\u00edmbolos Est\u00e1ndar Unicode\nlink\n\n\nSin ninguna duda puedes utilizar estos s\u00edmbolos en rich presence.\n\n\n\u258c\u258c=Pausa\n\n\ud83d\udd01=Continues\n\n\u23f0=Tiempo de la Partida/Reloj del Juego\n\n\ud83d\udd11=Llaves\n\n\ud83d\udca3=Bombas\n\n\u2764\ufe0f o \u2764=En un juego con corazones (ej. Zelda) \n\n\ud83d\udcb0=Dinero\n\n\ud83d\udea9=Nivel/Stage   \n\n\nCuando te encuentres desarrollando Rich Presence tienes que hacegurarte que te estas comunicando de una manera completamente clara. Si no estas utilizando s\u00edmbolos estandarizados tal vez tengan sentido para ti pero tal vez sea completamente confusos para otros. \nCuando utilices s\u00edmbolos no estandarizados, checalo con otro usuario\n o con alguna otra gente para ver si los s\u00edmbolos que estas utilizando tienen sentido. Si no lo tienen, utiliza mejores s\u00edmbolos, o  utiliza texto o s\u00edmbolos junto con texto.\n\n\nPara unicode/emojis personalizados \nShapeCatcher\n es un excelente recurso, puedes ponerte a dibujarlos y la AI va a buscar resultados similares. Simplemente ten cuidado de no utilizar unicode que sea \ndemasiado oscuro\n, ya que no se va a mostrar correctamente en todos los sistemas.\n\n\nToma nota en la preferencia de la comunidad en cuanto a displays:\n\n\n\nDesarrollando Rich Presence\nlink\n\n\nLa herramienta de desarrollo actualmente no cuenta con editor de Rich Presence integrado, pero puedes hacer pruebas locales antes de guardar algo en el servidor. Una vez que hubieras empezado un juego y el Rich Presence actual a sido descargado del servidor, puedes llegar a encontrar en \nRACache\\Data\\XXX-Rich.txt\n donde XXX es el ID del juego. \n\n\nEl Monitor de Rich Presence (ejecutable desde el menu de RetroAchievments) lee este archivo y muestra el valor actual cada segundo mientras la ventana se encuentre abierta.\n\n\nSi haces cambios al archivo \nXXX-Rich.txt\n, y vuelves a reseleccionar la opci\u00f3n de monitor del menu, este va a leer los nuevos cambios para aqu\u00ed as\u00ed puedas hacer pruebas inmediatamente sin tener que aplicar cambios al servidor. Continua haciendo cambios y vuelve a seleccionar la opci\u00f3n en el menu asta que el script trabaje como esperas que lo haga, una vez que hubieras terminado copia el contenido del archivo a la pagina del servidor para que est\u00e9n los cambios disponibles para todos los dem\u00e1s jugadores.\n\n\nNOTA\n: El archivo \nXXX-Rich.txt\n es sobre-escrito con la informaci\u00f3n actual del servidor cada vez que el juego es abierto. Mientras aun tengas el archivo abierto en un editor, siempre vas a poder guardar tus cambios a pesar de re-abrir el juego.\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-05-24 20:02] meleu:\n fix broken link\n\n\n[2019-05-19 15:48] eldexterr:\n Updated Rich Presence es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-19 15:42] eldexterr:\n Updated Rich Presence es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-17 11:03] eldexterr:\n Created Rich Presence es (markdown)",

Si la siguiente linea empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, se considera como un display con una string condicional. La parte de la linea que se encuentra entre los dos signos de interrogaci\u00f3n es la clausula de la condici\u00f3n. Si la clausula de la condici\u00f3n se eval\u00faa y esta es verdadera, entonces la siguiente parte de la linea se utiliza como el string del display. Si esta no se eval\u00faa como verdadera, entonces se procede a la siguiente linea. Si esta empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, entonces el mismo proceso se repite. Si este no empieza con un signo de interrogaci\u00f3n, la linea entera se utiliza como el string default para el display.  NOTA : Se requiere una string default en caso de que ninguna de tus strings condicionales sean verdaderas. Si solamente cuentas con strings condicionales, el script no va a hacer nada.  Observando este ejemplo, si el valor de 16-bit en $0085 es igual a 0, el string del display sera  Title Screen . Si no, la siguiente linea es examinada.

Strings de Display asociados con una clausula condicional soportan todo la misma sintaxis que el string de display predeterminado.

            "text": "Relacionado:\n \nLogros para hacks de ROM\n, \nSets Bonus\n\n\nSolamente un set es permitido por juego y por consola. Esto es aplica en casos de existente revisiones oficiales (ex. Rev A), parches oficiales, no-oficiales, y otras regiones.\n\n\nSets Bonus\n son una excepci\u00f3n de esta esta regla, pero son considerado como una extensi\u00f3n del set est\u00e1ndar y estos siguen reglas diferentes sobre el tipo de logros que son permitidos.\n\n\nSelecci\u00f3n de ROM\nlink\n\n\nCasi cualquier juego cuenta con m\u00faltiples versiones del ROM , algunas veces asta docenas. Y algunas veces hay diferencias bastante mayores hasta el punto en el que, un ROM ni siquiera es compatible con los logros de otro ROM del mismo juego. Entonces, encontrar el mejor ROM para desarrollar logros es importante y tiene que hacerse cuidadosamente.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeleccionando la Regi\u00f3n\n: Cuando sea posible escoge ROMs de \nNTSC USA\n no-intro, porque 60 FPS es una experiencia mucho mas fluida. Lanzamientos  \nPAL Europeos\n corren a 50 FPS, y la mayor\u00eda de los casos tienen que ser evadidos. Lanzamientos \nNTSC Japan\n tambi\u00e9n corren a 60 FPS , pero solamente son la mejor opci\u00f3n si el juego fue exclusivamente \n lanzado en Jap\u00f3n.  Utilizar como recurso la versi\u00f3n \nPAL Europea\n de un juego deber\u00eda de ser el ultimo recurso (Juego exclusivamente de Europa solamente), y son tipicamente muy pocos juegos y bastante \n\u00fanicos\n tambi\u00e9n, de toda la librer\u00eda de la consola. El problema de PAL/NTSC no aplica a la emulaci\u00f3n del GBA, que corre todas las versiones regionales a la misma cantidad de FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Mods\n: No utilizes ROM con una pantalla de inicio modificada/personalizada como Mode7 o RisingSun porque arruinan completamente la RAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Trainers\n: No utilices un ROM que incluya soporte para cheats integrado.  Estos son com\u00fanmente referidos como  \nROM trainers\n, no son oficiales, y no son compatibles por Retro Achievements de ninguna manera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo-Intro\nlink\n\n\nROMs de \nNo-Intro\n son el tipo de ROMs preferidos a ser linkeados a la base de datos de RA, y son los que deber\u00edas de utilizar para hacer tu set cuando sea esto posible. Ellos filtran malos dumps, hacks, fakes, overdumps, underdumps, etc. y solo muestra los ROMs que son mas fieles al cartucho original. ROMs de No-Intro ROMs pueden ser identificados de la siguiente manera:\n\n\nNombre del Juego (Regi\u00f3n) (Lenguajes Disponibles si es que aplica) (Revisi\u00f3n Actual si es que aplica)\n\n\nEjemplo:\n  Diddy Kong Racing (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev A)\n\n\nGoodTools \nNombre del Juego (Regi\u00f3n) [!]\n, aunque tambi\u00e9n algunos de los ROMs \nNombre del Juego (Regi\u00f3n) (Grupo de Rom Dumpers)\n son de una era mas temprana y tal vez sean iguales a la base de datos de No-Intro pero no es algo garantizado.\n\n\nPuedes verificar \naqu\u00ed\n que el checksum de tu ROM concuerda con el que se encuentra en la base de datos de No-Intro. Desafortunadamente algunos emuladores de RA no calculan correctamente el checksum (como el de  NES) as\u00ed que tal vez necesites encontrar tu checksum desde \notra fuente\n.\n\n\nParches de Traducci\u00f3n\nlink\n\n\n(tambi\u00e9n mira: \nP\u00f3liza de Localizaci\u00f3n de ROM\n mas abajo)\n\n\nIngles es el lenguaje primario de RetroAchievements. Los parches de traducci\u00f3n son algunas veces aplicados por los desarrolladores a t\u00edtulos que no se encuentran en ingles. En estos casos instrucciones de como parchear el ROM se van a encontrar en el foro del juego. Proveer un parche de traducci\u00f3n a un titulo existente permite que el juego sea mas accesible a otros usuarios. Tu tienes que inspeccionar profundamente la memoria para ver si el parche es completamente compatible con el set de logros y as\u00ed mandarlo como aprobaci\u00f3n para que lo cheque un desarrollador y as\u00ed lo pueda postear en el foro del juego.\n\n\nAlgunas veces los parches de traducci\u00f3n pueden llegar a diferir cr\u00edticamente del MD5 del desarrollador encontrando as\u00ed diferencias en la memoria original. Antes de linkear estos parches checa con el desarrollador original del juego o haz pruebas profundas en memoria para asegurarte que es completamente compatible. Puedes agregar parches de traducci\u00f3n que te hubieras encontrado en linea mientras todos los logros funcionen de manera correcta y no hagan al juego mas o menos dificil.\n\n\nP\u00f3liza de Localizaci\u00f3n de ROM\nlink\n\n\nComo Ingles es el lenguaje principal de la comunidad, ROMs en Ingles son preferidos. Cuando escojas que ROM deseas para construir logros entre todas las versiones regionales disponibles tu tienes que darle prioridad a los \nROMs No-Intro Americanos para consolas que no son port\u00e1tiles\n y \nROMs Europeos para consolas port\u00e1tiles\n. \n\n\nDamos la bienvenida y nos gustar\u00eda seguir mejorando nuestro soporte para todas las versiones regionales, especialmente Japones (ya que la mayor\u00eda de nuestra librer\u00eda de juegos fueron creados en Jap\u00f3n). Aparte, algunos usuarios simplemente prefieren versi\u00f3n regional en especifico de un juego y es al final de cuentas es mucho mejor incluir un soporte amplio para que cada buen ROM este linkeado a una buena entrada y as\u00ed se le den los logros apropiados.\n\n\nCuando miramos en como juegos con diferentes versiones regionales son manejados nuestro est\u00e1ndar es \nuna entrada por juego y por consola\n. Lo ideal seria que si alguien carga la versi\u00f3n Americana o Japonesa de Donkey Kong, Pac-Man o Contra, la gente consiga los mismos logros para la misma entrada. Pero hay algunas situaciones donde es mejor para nuestra librer\u00eda y jugadores separar las versiones regionales en sus propia entradas \u00fanicas. Si la comunidad tiene la raz\u00f3n en creer que es mejor que una entrada se parta en dos, esto puede ser revisado y aprobado por el equipo de desarrolladores despu\u00e9s de un votaci\u00f3n y discusi\u00f3n.\n\n\nDiferencias de Localizaci\u00f3n\nlink\n\n\nEl tipo de cambios hechos durante una localizaci\u00f3n (mas com\u00fanmente de Japones a Ingles) pueden varear bruscamente. Cualquiera de los siguientes cambios pueden ser resultados de una localizaci\u00f3n:\n\n\n\n\nPoquito o realmente ning\u00fan gran cambio;\n\n\nPasswords remplazan el sistema de guardado;\n\n\nCorrecci\u00f3n de Bugs;\n\n\nLigeras o traducciones extensas;\n\n\nLigeros o cambios cosm\u00e9ticos extensivos incluyendo estos, elementos considerados como ofensivos censurados, cambios en sfx, o assets licenciados cambiados a gen\u00e9ricos, o personajes desconocidos convertidos en personajes de Nintendo (ej. Tetris Attack, Super Mario Bros. 2);\n\n\nStages agregados, modificados o removidos;\n\n\nF\u00edsicas y mec\u00e1nicas del juego modificadas;\n\n\nModos de Juego, niveles de dificultad y opciones del juego modificadas o removidas;\n\n\nCheats o modo debug agregado o removido;\n\n\nEl juego fue rebalanceado haci\u00e9ndolo mas f\u00e1cil o mas dificil, algunas veces significativamente;\n\n\nDos juegos fueron combinados en uno;\n\n\ny mucho mas.\n\n\n\n\nDebido a estas variantes y para evitar llenar la base de datos de entradas duplicadas innecesarias nuestra meta es minimizar el numero de sets separados. Para que un set sea separado necesita razones suficientes; nos tomamos bastante cuidado cuando tenemos que aprobar este tipo de casos.\n\n\nSeparando una entrada regional\nlink\n\n\n1. Obtener aprobaci\u00f3n por medio del canal de Discord \n#revision-voting\n es requerido.\nlink\n\n\nLa aprobaci\u00f3n sigue el mismo m\u00e9todo de votaciones como cuando se va a trabajar una revisi\u00f3n, como postear tu plan en el foro del juego y en el canal de Discord de \n#revision-voting\n; permitiendo tiempo para discutirlo y esperar las 72 horas para que la mayor\u00eda pueda votar en las votaciones.\n\n\nRecuerda que la meta de reducir la duplicaci\u00f3n de entradas; solo se permite que un set se separe cuando es realmente comprensible.\n\n\nEl desarrollador que intente separar un set tiene que tener un fuerte motivo por el que el set merezca una nueva entrada y porque no es posible crear la experiencia que se desea con solamente una entrada.\n\n\nLos Desarrolladores que busquen partir un set tienen que venir con el acto de buena fe.

Y algunas veces hay diferencias bastante mayores hasta el punto en el que, un ROM ni siquiera es compatible con los logros de otro ROM del mismo juego. Entonces, encontrar el mejor ROM para desarrollar logros es importante y tiene que hacerse cuidadosamente.    Seleccionando la Regi\u00f3n : Cuando sea posible escoge ROMs de  NTSC USA  no-intro, porque 60 FPS es una experiencia mucho mas fluida. Lanzamientos   PAL Europeos  corren a 50 FPS, y la mayor\u00eda de los casos tienen que ser evadidos. Lanzamientos  NTSC Japan  tambi\u00e9n corren a 60 FPS , pero solamente son la mejor opci\u00f3n si el juego fue exclusivamente \n lanzado en Jap\u00f3n.  Utilizar como recurso la versi\u00f3n  PAL Europea  de un juego deber\u00eda de ser el ultimo recurso (Juego exclusivamente de Europa solamente), y son tipicamente muy pocos juegos y bastante  \u00fanicos  tambi\u00e9n, de toda la librer\u00eda de la consola. El problema de PAL/NTSC no aplica a la emulaci\u00f3n del GBA, que corre todas las versiones regionales a la misma cantidad de FPS.    No Mods : No utilizes ROM con una pantalla de inicio modificada/personalizada como Mode7 o RisingSun porque arruinan completamente la RAM.    No Trainers : No utilices un ROM que incluya soporte para cheats integrado.  Estos son com\u00fanmente referidos como   ROM trainers , no son oficiales, y no son compatibles por Retro Achievements de ninguna manera.",

Damos la bienvenida y nos gustar\u00eda seguir mejorando nuestro soporte para todas las versiones regionales, especialmente Japones (ya que la mayor\u00eda de nuestra librer\u00eda de juegos fueron creados en Jap\u00f3n).

Cuando miramos en como juegos con diferentes versiones regionales son manejados nuestro est\u00e1ndar es  una entrada por juego y por consola . Lo ideal seria que si alguien carga la versi\u00f3n Americana o Japonesa de Donkey Kong, Pac-Man o Contra, la gente consiga los mismos logros para la misma entrada. Pero hay algunas situaciones donde es mejor para nuestra librer\u00eda y jugadores separar las versiones regionales en sus propia entradas \u00fanicas.

Consulta con \nun administrador\n para una aprobaci\u00f3n mas especifica.\n\n\nEjemplo: \nMetroid - Rogue Dawn\n\n\nLanzamiento Beta, prototipo, correcci\u00f3n de un bug, re-balanceo, y hacks para \"testing\"\nlink\n\n\nNo est\u00e1n permitidos\n\n\nHacks para corregir un bug, parches de balance, versiones prototipo, hacks que est\u00e1n a nivel desarrollador y que cuentan con herramientas integradas (Selecci\u00f3n de Niveles f\u00e1cil de accesar, menus de debuging, menus que muestran informaci\u00f3n o proveen funciones de prueba y que no son normalmente accesibles en el juego normal), no pueden ser agregadas a un set core, y son tipicamente \nno permitidas\n que cuenten con su propio set de logros.\n\n\nSi un rom hack esta en un estado de beta con potenciales glitches que puedan romper el juego, crasheos, o bugs, intactos siendo un resultado del hack, esto \nno esta permitido\n.\n\n\nParches de Traducci\u00f3n\nlink\n\n\nPosiblemente Permitidos\n\n\nIngles es el Lenguaje Primario en RetroAchievements. Parches de traducci\u00f3n son algunas veces aplicados por los desarrolladores a t\u00edtulos que no son en Ingles cuando en el MD5 principal de un set de logros no existe un versi\u00f3n licenciada en ingles. En este tipo de casos instrucciones de como parchear el juego tienen que ser agregadas al foro del juego.  Proveer una traducci\u00f3n completa a un titulo existente es \nposiblemente permitido\n para que as\u00ed un juego sea mas accesible a gente que hable otros idiomas.  Recuerda que tienes que inspeccionar profundamente la memoria del juego entre el parche y el set core y meter una solicitud de aprobaci\u00f3n antes de que esta se entregue al desarrollador del set para que la postee en el foro junto con el parche.\n\n\nAlgunas veces los parches de traducci\u00f3n pueden diferir cr\u00edticamente de como trabaja la memoria de acuerdo al MD5 del desarrollador.  Antes de linkear estos parches checa con el desarrollador original o haz algunas pruebas profundas en memoria para asegurarte que sea completamente compatible. Puedes agregar parches de traducci\u00f3n que encuentres en linea siempre y cuanto todos los logros core funcionen de manera correcta y estos no se hagan mas o menos dif\u00edciles.\n\n\nHacks Cosm\u00e9ticos / Sprites\nlink\n\n\nPosiblemente permitidos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHacks Cosm\u00e9ticos / Sprites que no hacen nada mas que cambiar las gr\u00e1ficas del juego \nno est\u00e1n permitidos\n que tengan su propio set.  Tal vez sean un experiencia algo divertida pero siguen siendo el mismo juego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecuerda que:  Si un rom hack tiene suficientes diferencias del juego licenciado tantas que el juego puede ser considerado como un juego completamente diferente, es \nusualmente aceptable\n.  Consulta con \nun administrador\n para una aprobaci\u00f3n mas especifica.  Un simple hack de sprites \nno es suficiente\n para que tenga su propio set entero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEjemplo: \nRoll-chan Evolution, Episode I - Roll-chan Gaiden\n\n\nParches para Sets Bonus\nlink\n\n\nHacks Cosm\u00e9ticos que producen un MD5 \u00fanico para un \nSet Bonus\n son \nusualmente permitidos\n para que sean agregados al proceso de revisi\u00f3n.  Inclusive este tipo de parches tienen que ser testeada profundamente la memoria con el set core para asegurarte que todos los logros funcionan de manera correcta.

            "text": "Cuando escavamos en memoria en estas viejas consolas ayuda saber que los creadores originales de estos juegos trabajaron en ellos alguna vez. Si te familiarizas bien en la manera en la que trabaja tu consola favorita entonces hacer un set va a resultar mas sencillo y preciso.\n\n\nNES (RANes)\nlink\n\n\nDuplicado de Direcciones\nlink\n\n\n\n\nCuando utilices el inspector de memoria para encontrar variables en juegos de NES, va a ver 4 copias de todo lo que encuentres. Si te estas preguntando \"cual deber\u00eda de utilizar?\" o \"deberia probar cada una de ellas?\" no es tan complicado como parece.\n\n\nEsta es una caracter\u00edstica que el NES le da a los desarrolladores para encontrar mas maneras para buscar en memoria. Porque el NES en si solo tiene 2KB de RAM, el primer resultado (el que va abajo de 0x800) tiene que ser usado para consistencia, y aplicar condiciones adicionales en los otros realmente no hace nada.\n\n\nEsto tambi\u00e9n aplica para RPS y tablas clasificatorias tambi\u00e9n.\n\n\nGame Boy (RAVBA)\nlink\n\n\nMapa de Memoria\nlink\n\n\nAlgunos rangos de valores significan diferentes cosas en el contexto del hardware del Game Boy, as\u00ed que tener un mapa de lo que te puede resultar \u00fatil puede ayudar a eliminar esos valores que no sirven. As\u00ed es como se desplaya:\n\n\n\n\n\u274c \n0x0000 - 0x7FFF: Informaci\u00f3n del ROM\n (No hay raz\u00f3n para utilizarlo. Esta \u00e1rea contiene informaci\u00f3n del header que solamente la leen algunos emuladores.)\n\n\n\u274c \n0x8000 - 0x9FFF: Informaci\u00f3n de Gr\u00e1ficos\n (Algunas veces algunas cosas tal vez tengan sentido si lo que estas buscando es el ID de mapa o animaci\u00f3n , pero siempre va a ver otras maneras mejores de hacer las cosas as\u00ed intenta evitar el uso de cualquiera de estas)\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0f \n0xA000 - 0xBFFF: RAM del Cartucho\n (Ej. archivos de guardado. Algunas veces utilizar estas direcciones puede ser inevitable porque entonces tu set seria vulnerable a trampas cargando archivos de guardado de 100%. Mas informaci\u00f3n de como proteger tus logros contra archivos de guardado mas adelante)\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0f \n0xC000 - 0xDFFF: RAM de trabajo\n (Aqu\u00ed esta la bueno; casi todo lo que necesitas se encuentra en este rango)\n\n\n\u274c \n0xE000 - 0xFDFF: ECHO RAM\n (No la utilices, mira mas abajo)\n\n\n\u274c \n0xFE00 - 0xFE9F: Mas Informaci\u00f3n de Gr\u00e1ficos\n (lo mismo que informaci\u00f3n de gr\u00e1ficos de arriba)\n\n\n\u274c \n0xFEA0 - 0xFFFF: Variado\n (No lo utilices)\n\n\n\n\nPara mas informaci\u00f3n mira: \nhttp://gameboy.mongenel.com/dmg/asmmemmap.html\n\n\nECHO RAM\nlink\n\n\n\n\nSimilar que el NES, algunas variables tal vez se muestren mas de una vez cuando te encuentres buscando en el inspector de memoria. El segundo resultado es lo que se le conoce como ECHO RAM, que es un espejo de la memoria actual. Aunque algunos emuladores tienden a ignorar esta \u00e1rea o a emularla incorrectamente, se recomienda NO utilizarla para nada y siempre utilizar el primer resultado.\n\n\nEl Game Boy tiene 8KB de RAM empezando en 0xC000. La ECHO RAM empieza en 0xE000, as\u00ed que si tus direcciones empiezan con una E vas a tener que remplazar el primer car\u00e1cter que no tenga un cero con una C. Recuerda: C es lo correcto, E es la echo!\n\n\nGBC\nlink\n\n\nEn el GBC, los 4KB de memoria de 0xD000-0xDFFF son un banco para un bloque de memoria mas grande de 32kb que no es directamente accesible por el procesador. Los Bits 0-2 de 0xFF70 indican cual banco esta cargado en el bloque de memoria 0xD000-0xDFFF. Es una \"funci\u00f3n\" utilizada para expandir el almacenamiento de los ROMs del GBC mientras aun se tiene el soporte para ROMs del GB original.\n\n\nCambiar de Banco (cambiar el valor de 0xFF70) provoca que la memoria en el rango 0xD000-0xDFFF se actualice. Esto aparece como un flickering/parpadeando en el Visor de Memoria y provoca que la b\u00fasqueda de memoria sea mas complicada. Si estas escribiendo condiciones dependiendo de la memoria que se encuentra en ese bloque, tambi\u00e9n vas a requerir que 0xFF70 tenga un valor en especifico para asegurarte que estas utilizando el banco correcto. Los 4KB de memoria de 0xC000-0xCFFF no se cambian como el banco y pueden ser utilizados sin preocupaciones sin condiciones adicionales.\n\n\nNo es muy recomendable que utilices estas direcciones en tus logros si es que cuentas con al menos una alternativa para no utilizarnos. Desde Enero del 2018, RALibretro solamente muestra el banco de 0x00 a 0xFF70. RetroArch a estado fluctuando los bancos de memoria, pero algunos valores no funcionan de la misma manera que en RAVisualBoyAdvance. Al menos asta que RetroArch reciba una inspector de memoria, logros que utilicen direcciones en 0xD000-0xDFFF solamente van a funcionar en RAVisualBoyAdvance.\n\n\nGB/GBC BIOS\nlink\n\n\nRALibRetro y RetroArch cuenta con soporte para el BIOS de GB/GBC, que muestra los logos de \"Nintendo\" y \"GameBoy\" antes de empezar el juego. Esto provee aproximadamente cuatro segundo donde la memoria principal ($C000-$DFFF) aun no a sido inicializada, y podr\u00eda provocar que algunos logros se disparen cuando se cargue el juego por algunos usuarios que tienen el BIOS habilitado.\n\n\nPara habilitar esta caracter\u00edstica, pon el archivo del bios (de nombre \ngb_bios.bin\n o \ngbc_bios.bin\n) en el folder del directorio del sistema ya sea el de RALibRetro o RetroArch. Cuando empieces el juego, vas a ver los logos de \"Nintendo\" y \"GameBoy\" antes de proceder al juego actual.\n\n\nSi esto te esta causando problemas, tal vez necesites agregar un poco de l\u00f3gica para prevenir que los logros salten cuando se encuentre el jugador en el BIOS, pero seria preferible que agregues l\u00f3gica del juego si es posible (ej. cuando se muestra una pantalla en especifico).\n\n\nEl c\u00f3digo del BIOS es cargado en $0000-$00FF, as\u00ed que identifica ese pedazo de memoria cuando est\u00e9s en el BIOS y haz que lo ignore tu logro. Por ejemplo, los \u00faltimos cuatro bytes del bloque del BIOS del GBC son \n3E 11 E0 50\n, asi que podr\u00edas agregar esta condici\u00f3n al logro para prevenir que el logro salte cuando el BIOS se encuentra corriendo.\n\n\n32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0113E\n\n\n\n\nDespu\u00e9s de que el BIOS se termina, el bloque es rellenado con puras FF's, y es re-asignado para vectores de interrupci\u00f3n. Para mas detalles, mira \nUn vistazo a la pantalla de inicio del GameBoy\n.\n\n\nNOTA\n: Los \u00faltimos cuatro bytes del BIOS del GB son \n3E 01 E0 50\n. As\u00ed que la condici\u00f3n para el BIOS seria:\n\n\n32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0013E\n\n\n\n\nNintendo 64 (RAP64)\nlink\n\n\nUtilizando c\u00f3digos GameShark para Direcciones\nlink\n\n\nLos c\u00f3digos de GameShark pueden ser un valioso recurso para encontrar direcciones que no puedes o sientes que no las puedes encontrar. Estos cuentan con 12 caracteres por linea y son sencillamente f\u00e1ciles de compilar.\n\n\n[AA][BBBBBB] [CCCC]\n\n\n[AA] es el tipo de c\u00f3digo. Esta es una peque\u00f1a instrucci\u00f3n para el GameShark que define que hacer con el siguiente valor. Si entiendes que es lo que hace ese c\u00f3digo GameShark puedes utilizar como ayuda para crear una condici\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n\n80, 88:\n La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Pone el valor en [00CC] en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB].\n\n\n81, 89:\n La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Pone el valor en [CCCC] en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB].\n\n\nD0:\n La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Checa si [00CC] es igual al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.\n\n\nD2:\n La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Checa si [00CC] es DIFERENTE al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.\n\n\nD1:\n La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Checa si [CCCC] es igual al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.\n\n\nD3:\n La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Checa si [CCCC] es DIFERENTE al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.\n\n\n\n\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1n algunos ejemplos:\n* Paper Mario: HP Infinito:\n\n\n[80][10F292] [0032]\n\n\nCambia el valor de 8-bit en 0x10F292 a 0x32 (50). Entonces esto significa que el HP de Mario es un valor de 8-bit en 0x10F292.\n\n\n\n\nDonkey Kong 64: Juega como Rambi: \n\n\n\n\n[80][74E77C] [0006]\n\n\nCambia el valor de 8-bit en 0x74E77C a 6. Entonces esto significa que el personaje el cual estas utilizando ahora es un valor de 8-bit en 0x74E77C.\n\n\n\n\nChameleon Twist 2: Deja presionado L para hacer el Moon Jump:\n\n\n\n\n[D0][18BAB5] [0020] <- Estamos revisando este\n\n\n[81][18B9E0] [4200]\n\n\nCheca si el valor de 8-bit en 0x18BAB5 es igual a 0x20. Esto significa que 0x18BAB5 contiene una variable de presionado de bot\u00f3n y el Bit5 (0x20) corresponde a la L.\n\n\nAnti-GSC\n y \nGameHacking\n los dos son buenos recursos para encontrar c\u00f3digos de GameShark.\n\n\nNeo Geo\nlink\n\n\nProtecci\u00f3n Obligatoria del UniBIOS\nlink\n\n\nUniBIOS permite severas opciones de desarrollador, y tambi\u00e9n accesa a la base de datos de cheats de cada juego. Por eso mismo todos los logros para Neo Geo necesitan estar protegidos de esto. La soluci\u00f3n mas simple para hacer esto es desabilitar el uso del UniBIOS completamente, directamente desde el c\u00f3digo de logro.\n\n\nAfortunadamente la parte de la data del UniBIOS parece ser reflejada en dos cadenas de direcciones en la RAM: \n0x00fe30\n y \n0x00fe50\n. Mientras el UniBIOS este activo \n0x00fe30\n en 32-bit parece mostrar siempre el mismo valor (para cada uno de los juegos de Neo Geo game) que es \n80025632\n, y no parece que cambie despu\u00e9s que el ROM ya fue cargado. Para cualquier otro BIOS, el valor siempre es 0, (excepto en el momento en el que la RAM es cargada de nuevo en el programa de diagnostico, despu\u00e9s de haber cargado el ROM).\n\n\nPara proteger tus logros del uso completo del UniBIOS lo \u00fanico que necesitamos hacer es incluir una simple protecci\u00f3n que se va resetear cuando el valor de 32-bit en \n0x00fe30\n no sea igual a \n0\n. Esto adicionalmente protege, al logro de que salte durante el proceso de diagnostico de RAM.\n\n\nAs\u00ed es como se deber\u00eda de ver la protecci\u00f3n (seleccionada en el Editor de Logros):\n\n\n\n\nAs\u00ed es como se ve la misma regi\u00f3n de la RAM cuando se utilizan otros BIOS (utilizando MSV):\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nlink\n\n\nLast 10 changes on this page:\n\n\n\n\n[2019-05-23 10:07] eldexterr:\n Updated Console Specific Tips es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-23 09:59] eldexterr:\n Updated Console Specific Tips es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-23 09:59] eldexterr:\n Updated Console Specific Tips es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-22 14:57] eldexterr:\n Updated Console Specific Tips es (markdown)\n\n\n[2019-05-22 11:42] eldexterr:\n Created Console Specific Tips es (markdown)",

            "text": "RALibRetro y RetroArch cuenta con soporte para el BIOS de GB/GBC, que muestra los logos de \"Nintendo\" y \"GameBoy\" antes de empezar el juego. Esto provee aproximadamente cuatro segundo donde la memoria principal ($C000-$DFFF) aun no a sido inicializada, y podr\u00eda provocar que algunos logros se disparen cuando se cargue el juego por algunos usuarios que tienen el BIOS habilitado.  Para habilitar esta caracter\u00edstica, pon el archivo del bios (de nombre  gb_bios.bin  o  gbc_bios.bin ) en el folder del directorio del sistema ya sea el de RALibRetro o RetroArch. Cuando empieces el juego, vas a ver los logos de \"Nintendo\" y \"GameBoy\" antes de proceder al juego actual.  Si esto te esta causando problemas, tal vez necesites agregar un poco de l\u00f3gica para prevenir que los logros salten cuando se encuentre el jugador en el BIOS, pero seria preferible que agregues l\u00f3gica del juego si es posible (ej. cuando se muestra una pantalla en especifico).  El c\u00f3digo del BIOS es cargado en $0000-$00FF, as\u00ed que identifica ese pedazo de memoria cuando est\u00e9s en el BIOS y haz que lo ignore tu logro. Por ejemplo, los \u00faltimos cuatro bytes del bloque del BIOS del GBC son  3E 11 E0 50 , asi que podr\u00edas agregar esta condici\u00f3n al logro para prevenir que el logro salte cuando el BIOS se encuentra corriendo.  32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0113E  Despu\u00e9s de que el BIOS se termina, el bloque es rellenado con puras FF's, y es re-asignado para vectores de interrupci\u00f3n. Para mas detalles, mira  Un vistazo a la pantalla de inicio del GameBoy .  NOTA : Los \u00faltimos cuatro bytes del BIOS del GB son  3E 01 E0 50 . As\u00ed que la condici\u00f3n para el BIOS seria:  32-bit 0x00FC != 0x50E0013E",

            "text": "Los c\u00f3digos de GameShark pueden ser un valioso recurso para encontrar direcciones que no puedes o sientes que no las puedes encontrar. Estos cuentan con 12 caracteres por linea y son sencillamente f\u00e1ciles de compilar.  [AA][BBBBBB] [CCCC]  [AA] es el tipo de c\u00f3digo. Esta es una peque\u00f1a instrucci\u00f3n para el GameShark que define que hacer con el siguiente valor. Si entiendes que es lo que hace ese c\u00f3digo GameShark puedes utilizar como ayuda para crear una condici\u00f3n.   80, 88:  La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Pone el valor en [00CC] en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB].  81, 89:  La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Pone el valor en [CCCC] en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB].  D0:  La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Checa si [00CC] es igual al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.  D2:  La direcci\u00f3n es de 8-bit. Checa si [00CC] es DIFERENTE al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.  D1:  La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Checa si [CCCC] es igual al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.  D3:  La direcci\u00f3n es de 16-bit. Checa si [CCCC] es DIFERENTE al valor en la direcci\u00f3n [BBBBBB] entonces ejecuta la siguiente linea si as\u00ed lo es.   Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n algunos ejemplos:\n* Paper Mario: HP Infinito:  [80][10F292] [0032]  Cambia el valor de 8-bit en 0x10F292 a 0x32 (50). Entonces esto significa que el HP de Mario es un valor de 8-bit en 0x10F292.   Donkey Kong 64: Juega como Rambi:    [80][74E77C] [0006]  Cambia el valor de 8-bit en 0x74E77C a 6. Entonces esto significa que el personaje el cual estas utilizando ahora es un valor de 8-bit en 0x74E77C.   Chameleon Twist 2: Deja presionado L para hacer el Moon Jump:   [D0][18BAB5] [0020] <- Estamos revisando este  [81][18B9E0] [4200]  Checa si el valor de 8-bit en 0x18BAB5 es igual a 0x20. Esto significa que 0x18BAB5 contiene una variable de presionado de bot\u00f3n y el Bit5 (0x20) corresponde a la L.  Anti-GSC  y  GameHacking  los dos son buenos recursos para encontrar c\u00f3digos de GameShark.",

Por eso mismo todos los logros para Neo Geo necesitan estar protegidos de esto. La soluci\u00f3n mas simple para hacer esto es desabilitar el uso del UniBIOS completamente, directamente desde el c\u00f3digo de logro.  Afortunadamente la parte de la data del UniBIOS parece ser reflejada en dos cadenas de direcciones en la RAM:  0x00fe30  y  0x00fe50 . Mientras el UniBIOS este activo  0x00fe30  en 32-bit parece mostrar siempre el mismo valor (para cada uno de los juegos de Neo Geo game) que es  80025632 , y no parece que cambie despu\u00e9s que el ROM ya fue cargado. Para cualquier otro BIOS, el valor siempre es 0, (excepto en el momento en el que la RAM es cargada de nuevo en el programa de diagnostico, despu\u00e9s de haber cargado el ROM).  Para proteger tus logros del uso completo del UniBIOS lo \u00fanico que necesitamos hacer es incluir una simple protecci\u00f3n que se va resetear cuando el valor de 32-bit en  0x00fe30  no sea igual a  0 . Esto adicionalmente protege, al logro de que salte durante el proceso de diagnostico de RAM.  As\u00ed es como se deber\u00eda de ver la protecci\u00f3n (seleccionada en el Editor de Logros):   As\u00ed es como se ve la misma regi\u00f3n de la RAM cuando se utilizan otros BIOS (utilizando MSV):",
